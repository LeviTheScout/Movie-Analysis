7,"The banished prince. Let's offer him lunch. I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us. As you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the Prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar. The Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne. I commend the Fire Lord's discipline. For example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform. But we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume. One day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me. You OK? I'll be fine.
