Da-song is an artist by nature. Look at this painting. It's so metaphorical. It's really strong. Strong, right? You've got an eye for this. It's a chimpanzee, right? A self-portrait. Sure enough!

Anyway, after studying applied arts at Illinois State University, she returned to Korea. Illinois... tell me more. Her teaching is unusual, but she knows how to handle kids. She's got a special reputation in her field. But even though her methods are unique, she can help kids get into good art schools. Now I'm really curious. What is she like? Would you like to meet her?
