At last. Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what. Wait a minute. Where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans! And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

2,"I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan. You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away! Holding her is dangerous. If word gets out... it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate. I have traced the rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. She'll die before she'll tell you anything. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed. Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship... and no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. Yes, sir. How did we get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.

Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain. Uncle Owen, what about that one? What about that blue one? We'll take that one. - Take this away. - You'll be pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Let's go. Don't you forget this.

5,"- Have you been in many battles? - Several, I think. There's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyway. Well, my little friend... you got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a Starcruiser or-- Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? ""What is what''? He asked you a question. What is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.

He's our new master. You're my only hope. He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts... and it's a private message for him. Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles. But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi. I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan... but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.

6,"He suggests that if you remove the bolt... he might be able to play back the entire recording. Oh, yeah. Well... I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off. Okay. There you go. Where'd she go? Bring her back. Play back the entire message. ""What message''? The one you've just been playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards. Luke! Luke! I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Here. See what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either. - That R2 unit might have been stolen. - What makes you think that? I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? I wonder if he's related to Ben. That wizard's just a crazy old man. Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't. I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. - He knew my father? - I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow. In the morning, I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers. Yes, sir. I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.

7,"Sure. There's more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. It's only one season more. This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands... and then you can go to the academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. - But it's a whole 'nother year. - It's only one more season. That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left. - Where are you going? - Looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to go finish cleaning those droids. Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of. - What are you doing hiding back there? - It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. - Kept babbling on about his mission. - Oh, no. That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. - Blast it. - Couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down. I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. -That droid's gonna cause me trouble. -He excels at that, sir. Come on. Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early. - Did he take those new droids with him? - I think so.

8,"Where do you think you're going? Master Luke is your rightful owner now. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish. Don't talk to me of your mission. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go. What's wrong with him now? There are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Sandpeople. Or worse. Come on. Let's go have a look. Come on. There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any-- Wait a second. They're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. Hello there. Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry. He'll be all right. Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

9,"Very interesting. I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled... but they'll soon be back-- and in greater numbers. 3PO. Where am I? I must have taken a bad step. Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly. They're on the move. My father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. - You fought in the Clone Wars? - Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father. I wish I'd known him. He was the best starpilot in the galaxy... and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough... but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan... on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did. Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while. Go ahead. - What is it? - It's your father's lightsabre. This is the weapon of a Jedi knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age.

10,"before the dark times... before the Empire. How did my father die? Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader... who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil... helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. The Force? The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, little friend... and where you come from. - I saw part of a message-- - I seem to have found it. General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request in person. But my ship has fallen under attack... and my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion... into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've gotta get home. I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke.

11,"But there's nothing I can do about it right now. - It's all such a long way from here. - That's your uncle talking. Oh, boy. My uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Learn about the Force, Luke. I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course. Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander... not to this battle station. The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate-- The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over their territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. - Fear of this battle station. - And what of the rebellion?

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained.

12,"next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion... has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes... or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress-- I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this. Vader, release him. As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress... by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke. It looks like the Sandpeople did this. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before.

30,"The approach will not be easy. You're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench... and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two metres wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a computer. No, it's not.
