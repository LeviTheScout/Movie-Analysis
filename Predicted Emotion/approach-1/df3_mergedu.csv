While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked. He had one part-time job as a projectionist. A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few. So someone has to be there to switch the projectors, at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins. If you look for them, you can see little dots, come into the upper right corner of the screen. In the industry we call them, cigarette burns. That's the cue for a changeover. He flips the projectors, movie keeps right on going and nobody in the audience has any idea. Why would anyone want this shit job? Because it affords him other interesting opportunities. Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films. So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel three, that's when you will catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film. Nobody knows that they saw it but they did. Nice big cock. Even a humming bird couldn't catch Tyler at work.

24,"Yeah, with enough soap, one could blow up just about anything. Tyler was full of useful information. Now ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner when washed in a certain point of the river. You know why? No. Because human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Bodies burned, water seeped through the wooden ashes to create lye. This is lye. The crucial ingredient. Once it mixed with the melted fat of the bodies, thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. May I see your hand, please? What is this? This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you have ever been burned and you will have a scar. What are you doing? Kind of meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this. Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out. No God! God! Look at your hand. The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing.
