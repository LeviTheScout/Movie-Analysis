2,"The gods want us farmers dead! That's right! We're better off dead! What's all this? Crying won't change anything. The magistrate can do more than collect taxes. We can ask him for help. We know all about him! He shows up after they're gone, acting big while he surveys the damage. That's right. He's useless. We might as well hand over our rice and barley to the bandits and just hang ourselves! That'll bring the magistrate here in a hurry! We'll kill those bandits. We'll kill them all. Never again! Let's kill 'em all! Not me! I couldn't possibly -- That's crazy talk. So we can kill defeated samurai but not bandits? Stop it! This is no time to fight amongst ourselves. We don't have a chance against bandits. And when we lose? They'll slaughter us all, down to the last unborn child. I've had enough! Better to risk it all than to live like this. Kill or be killed! Rikichi! The farmer's only choice is to endure. We can't defy the powerful. When the bandits arrive, we'll greet them meekly and quietly hand over all our barley.

3,"Have you forgotten how low we had to stoop for the rice we're eating now? We should go see the Old Man. Let him decide what to do. Consider who we're dealing with here. Give a wolf a taste of your leg and he'll ask for your hand. Once they have a taste, they'll be back in the fall. - But what if we lose? - Then we're no worse off! Without our barley, we're doomed anyway! We fight. Old Man, that's madness. We're farmers. What do we know of battle? We'll hire samurai. Whoever heard of farmers hiring samurai? I saw it with my own eyes, when the village you were born in was torched. I saw it when we escaped to this village here. The only village that didn't burn was the one that hired samurai. But Old Man, there are different kinds of villages and villagers. How are we to feed samurai when we live on rice gruel? We'll make do on millet! Show me a samurai who'll fight for farmers in return for food! They're a proud lot. Look. Find hungry samurai. Even bears come down from the mountains when they're hungry. How dare you?

4,"What'd I tell you? Look, the barley's ripe. Ten days already since we left the village. What do we do? This barley's early, not like our mountain barley. Hey, we're soaked through to the bone. Find any cheap, strong and foolhardy samurai? Leftovers. You can have 'em cheap. That's a laugh! - What's so funny? - He's blind. - What about you, then? - Not me. I'd rather eat horseshit. - Won't get a nose bleed outta him. - Cleaned him out gambling last night. Pulled his sword when he lost, so the three of us beat him up. Not a drop left in his nose now. Don't bother. They only eat millet. Is that true? You can't live like that. Without nourishment you'll go night-blind. I've got just four left. I'll trade 'em all for a cup of rice. What do you say? Damn! What a bunch. What a waste. If we still had that rice, we coulda bought 40 of those. Shut up! But it's true, right? The blockhead's cracking up! What a show. Go at it, boys.

Let's hurry and get back to the village. Go on home. You can't afford buns, let alone samurai. Farmers like us know good from bad when it comes to seed, but not when it comes to samurai.

6,There's a thief in that barn. We raised a ruckus and he ran in to hide. How many thieves are there? Just one. One? All of you can't take a single thief? We don't dare make a move. He took a kid in there with him. Says he'll kill him if we attack. Listen. Hear him? Poor thing. It all happened in the middle of the night. Poor kid's been bawling the better part of a day. He can barely make a sound now. He's only seven. Imagine how his parents feel. Who's that samurai getting his head shaved? No idea. We asked him for help and he agreed right away. Then he asked us for two rice balls. He asked a monk to shave his head and lend him his robes. No idea what he's up to. Stay back! Any closer and I kill the brat! I'm a monk. Stay back! I'm just a monk. I mean you no harm. I won't come in. I just thought the child must be very hungry. I've brought some rice balls. You should eat one yourself. Won't you have one? What's wrong?

8,"- I thought of that. - But, sir -- This isn't a game. They may be bandits, but they ride 40 strong. Two or three samurai won't suffice. Defense is more difficult than offense. You say there are mountains behind the village? Yes. Passable by horse? Yes. Fields in front. Until those are flooded with water, you're open to mounted attack on four sides. You need at least four men, one to guard each side. Two more to guard the rear. No matter how frugal our estimate, we need seven, including me. We can manage seven somehow. But the Old Man said four. It's only three more. Hold on a second. I haven't accepted your offer. I'm only speculating. First of all, it's not easy to find trustworthy samurai. What's more, all you have to offer is food. Only those out to fight for the hell of it will agree. Besides, I'm sick of fighting. Age, I suppose. Good thing I wasn't born a peasant. Better to be born a dog. Goddamn it.

9,"Like you would know. How dare you? You heard right. If you know, why don't you help them? So you wanna fight? That's enough. Enough! Hey, samurai, look at this. This here's your dinner. But what do you think these blockheads eat? Millet. They eat millet to feed you white rice. This is the best they can offer. What do you say to that? - All right, then. - What? Quit your jabbering. I won't let this rice go to waste. Manzo and the others are back! Where are Rikichi and Yohei? They stayed behind. We still need more samurai. The samurai are coming? They sure are. Seven of 'em. Seven? Seven. I was against it because you said four, Old Man. I figured we'd need at least ten. But if I'd said ten, we'd have ended up with 15. That's the way it goes. Old Man, I'm worried.

They've attacked from the east, west and south and run away each time with their tails between their legs. This is the only approach left. We don't know if they'll come tonight, but when they do, they'll mass their forces here. Perhaps, but... I don't hear a thing. Nevertheless, this will surely be the focus of their attack. I'll prove it to you in a minute. Good work. Now poke that scarecrow out from behind those trees. I'd say tomorrow morning they'll attack us here with everything they've got. And we'll let them in. Don't worry. I mean we'll let one in. Two at most. Once they're in, we form a wall again with our spears. The one or two who get in are as good as dead. We can cook 'em up any way we want.
