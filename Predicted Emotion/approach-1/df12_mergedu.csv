1,"Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit. You always say that, the same thing every time. ""I'm through, never again, too dangerous."" I know that's what I always say. I'm always right, too. But you forget about it in a day or two. Yeah, well, the days of me forgetting are over, and the days of me remembering have just begun. You know when you go on like this what you sound like? I sound like a sensible fucking man... - You sound like a duck. - ...that's what I sound like. Take heart, cause you're never gonna have to hear it again, 'cause since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack - about how I'm never gonna do it again. - After tonight. Correct. I got all tonight to quack. Can I get anyone more coffee? Oh, yes. Thank you. You're welcome. I mean, the way it is now, you're taking the same risk as when you rob a bank. Taking more of a risk. Banks are easier. Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery. They're insured. Why should they give a fuck? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone. He gives the phone to the teller, bloke on the other end of the phone says, ""We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna Kill her."" - Did it work? - Fucking right, it worked. That's what I'm talking about. Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone. Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fucking phone. Cleans the place out. They don't even lift a fucking finger. Did they hurt the little girl? I don't know. There probably never was a little girl in the first place. The point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is, they robbed a bank with a telephone. - You want to rob banks? - I'm not saying I want to rob banks. I'm just illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we been doing. And no more liquor stores? What we been talking about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.",88.98899999999998,387,Forget it It is too risky I am through doing shit You always say that same thing time I am through never again too dangerous I know that is what I always say I am always right too But you forget about it in day or Yeah well days of me forgetting are over and days of me remembering have just begun You know when you go on like this what you sound like I sound like sensible fucking man You sound like duck that is what I sound like Take heart because you are never going to have to hear it again because since I am never going to do it again you are never going to have to hear me quack about how I am never going to do it again After tonight Correct I got all tonight to quack Can I get anyone more coffee Oh yes Thank you You are welcome I mean way it is now you are taking same risk as when you rob bank Taking more of risk Banks are easier Federal banks are not supposed to stop you in way during robbery They are insured Why should they give fuck You do not even need gun in federal bank I heard about one bloke he walks into bank with portable phone He gives phone to teller bloke on other end of phone says We got guy 's little girl If you do not give him your money we are going to Kill her Did it work Fucking right it worked That is what I am talking about walks into bank with telephone Not pistol not shotgun fucking phone Cleans place out They do not even lift fucking finger Did they hurt little girl I do not know There probably never was little girl in first place point of story is not little girl point of story is they robbed bank with telephone You want to rob banks I am not saying I want to rob banks I am just illustrating if we did it would be easier than what we been doing And no more liquor stores What we been talking about Yeah no more liquor stores,annoyance
2,"Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't even speak fucking English. Tell 'em, ""Empty out the register,"" they don't know what you're talking about. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of these gook fucker's gonna make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody. I don't want to kill anybody, either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them. And if it's not the gooks, it's these old fucking Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations. You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking magnum in his hand. Try walking into one of those places with nothing but a phone, see how far that gets you. Fuck it. Forget it. We're out of it. Yeah, well, what then? Day jobs? - Not in this life. - What, then? Gargon, coffee! This place. ""Gargor!' means ""boy."" This place? A coffee shop? What's wrong with that? Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations. You'll get your head blown off sticking up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed. Not as expecting, anyway. I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this. Correct. Same as banks, these places are insured. Manager. He don't give a fuck. He's just trying to get you out the door before you start plugging the diners. Waitresses? Fucking forget it. No way they're taking a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback getting paid $1.50 an hour, really give a fuck you're stealing from the owner? Customers sitting there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's going on.

3,"See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. Remember? All the customers kept coming in? Yeah. You got the idea taking their wallets. - Now, that was a good idea. - Thank you.

Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal. You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffing away. I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places. - And those are hash bars? - Yeah, it breaks down like this, okay? It's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, but that doesn't matter. ""Cause, get a load of this, all right? If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have. Oh, man, I'm going. That's all there is to it. - I'm fucking going. - I know, baby. You'd dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is? - What? - It's the little differences.

We should have fucking shotguns. - What's her name? - Mia. Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet? I don't know. However people meet people. She used to be an actress. Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen? I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. Pilot? What's a pilot? Well, you know the shows on TV? I don't watch TV. Yeah, but you are aware that there's an invention called television, and on this invention, they show shows, right? Yeah. Well, the way they pick TV shows is, they make one show.

Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, used to call him ""Tony Rocky Horror""? Yeah, maybe. Fat, right? I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. I mean, he got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do? He's Samoan. Yeah, I think I know who you mean. What about him? Well, Marsellus fucked him up good. Word around the campfire is, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife. So, what'd he do, fuck her? No, no, no. Nothing that bad. Well then, what, then? Gave her a foot massage. A foot massage? That's it? Then what did Marsellus do? Sent a couple of cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had a little garden down at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse. Nigger fell through that. Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment. That's a damn shame. But still, I have to say, you play with matches, you get burned. What do you mean? You don't be giving Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage. You don't think he overreacted? Well, Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction. It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothing.

No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I mean, I understand that Marsellus is very, very protective of you. A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else. But did it happen? Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding. Really?
