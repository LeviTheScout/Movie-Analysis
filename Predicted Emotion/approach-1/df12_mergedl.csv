The child must be in his 13th year before the rite can be performed on the dawn of winter. The rite. Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel, as a container for his power. The ritual will transform his essence, his soul into the boy. There will be no more Danny. Only Roarke. No! Why the hell didn't you tell us this? Hey. You made a deal with Roarke! Both of you!
