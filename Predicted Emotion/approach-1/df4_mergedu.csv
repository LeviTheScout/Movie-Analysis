1,"(BUS APPROACHING) Hello. My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump. Do you want a chocolate? I could eat about a million and a half of these. My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt. Mama always said there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes: where they're going, where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard, I could remember my first pair of shoes. Mama said they'd take me anywhere. She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around. How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump, as strong as I've ever seen, but his back is as crooked as a politician. But we're gonna straighten him right up, now, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! FORREST: Now, when I was a baby, Mama named me after the great Civil War hero, General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense. (CLANG) Okay... Get it, get it... Wait, is it this way? Hold on. All right... What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest. If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs. FORREST: Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago, something like that. Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.

3,"You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his IQ is 75. Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock. FORREST: She wanted me to have the finest education, so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School. I met the principal and all. I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal. Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine. What does ""normal"" mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else. He's not going to some special school to learn how to re-tread tires.
