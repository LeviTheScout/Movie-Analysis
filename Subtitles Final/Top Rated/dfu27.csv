767,4161949,4163616,Hope I'm not troubling you.
768,4164285,4166411,"Well, that depends, Mr...?"
769,4166579,4170623,"Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain."
770,4171834,4173209,The Green Mile.
771,4173419,4176546,"Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way."
772,4177298,4179924,I'd like to ask you about one of them.
773,4181177,4183178,"- Have a seat.
- Thank you."
774,4187933,4189684,Which client?
775,4191145,4193938,Now you got my curiosity aroused.
776,4194148,4196524,"- John Coffey.
- Ah."
777,4196692,4198109,Coffey.
778,4198277,4199485,He causing you problems?
779,4199945,4203531,"No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion..."
780,4203741,4205617,...but other than that...
781,4205784,4209078,"He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say."
782,4209288,4210830,You know what he did.
783,4211498,4213541,I read the court transcript.
784,4214460,4217212,"- Thank you, missus.
- My pleasure."
785,4218088,4221382,"Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up."
786,4221634,4222926,"TOGETHER:
Coming, Mama!"
787,4223135,4226262,"What exactly are you
trying to find out?"
788,4226847,4229182,"I've wondered if he did anything
like that before."
789,4230643,4232644,Why? Has he said anything?
790,4232811,4235980,"No, but a man who does
a thing like that..."
791,4236190,4240109,"...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me..."
792,4240319,4244197,"...that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out."
793,4244990,4248785,"A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace."
794,4248994,4251996,"You'd think so, but you'd be wrong."
795,4252164,4254332,"Believe me, we tried."
796,4255167,4257335,Like he'd dropped out of the sky.
797,4258170,4259587,How can that be?
798,4259838,4264008,"We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work."
799,4264218,4268263,"People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass."
800,4268514,4271641,"Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere."
801,4272393,4274727,"Not until he kills
a couple of little girls."
802,4275562,4277188,He is...
803,4277523,4279565,"...strange, I admit."
804,4279942,4284237,"But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him."
805,4284697,4287115,"I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith."
806,4287366,4290201,I deal with them day in and day out.
807,4290995,4293663,"You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before."
808,4293872,4296791,"You came to see if I think
he did it at all."
809,4298210,4299877,Do you?
810,4301088,4303256,"One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case."
811,4303465,4305550,"He was found with the victims
in his arms."
812,4305718,4307552,And yet you defended him.
813,4308554,4311139,Everyone is entitled to a defense.
814,4311557,4313182,"MRS. HAMMERSMITH:
Kids! Lunch!"
815,4313392,4314684,Y'all listen to your mama!
816,4319315,4320898,I'll tell you something.
817,4321942,4325570,"And you listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know."
818,4325738,4327113,I'm listening.
819,4328574,4330491,We had us a dog.
820,4330659,4332702,Just a sweet mongrel.
821,4332911,4334412,You know the kind.
822,4335748,4339208,"Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro."
823,4340085,4341836,You get to know it.
824,4342046,4346424,"Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use..."
825,4346592,4350136,"...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you."
826,4351638,4355767,"If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different."
827,4356852,4359062,My wife and I were not so lucky.
828,4361023,4362565,"Caleb, come here for a second."
829,4363942,4365151,Come here.
830,4366612,4367862,"Please, son."
831,4369448,4371949,He still has the one good eye.
832,4373285,4375578,I suppose he's lucky...
833,4375788,4378122,...not to be completely blind.
834,4380834,4384629,"We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least."
835,4385297,4386672,"Right, Caleb?"
836,4389134,4390468,"Okay, go on in now."
837,4393889,4396808,"That dog attacked my boy
for no reason."
838,4397434,4399644,Just got it in his mind one day.
839,4400396,4401854,The same with John Coffey.
840,4402064,4406317,"He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt."
841,4406985,4408820,But those little girls...
842,4409029,4411489,...stayed raped and murdered.
843,4412157,4414158,Maybe he'd never done it before.
844,4415911,4418079,My dog never bit before.
845,4419832,4422542,But I didn't concern myself with that.
846,4423544,4427505,"I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out."
847,4428882,4430049,Is Coffey guilty?
848,4433011,4434720,"Yes, he is."
849,4435347,4437014,Don't you doubt it.
850,4437349,4439851,And don't you turn your back on him.
851,4440686,4444856,"You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times..."
852,4445691,4447358,...but in the end...
853,4449361,4450820,...you'll get bit.

867,4506460,4508127,Several times.
868,4523644,4527146,"Oh, John, I can smell that

869,4530025,4532318,Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?
870,4532945,4536489,"Well, it's yours, John.

872,4543789,4547458,"Hey! What about me?

873,4549545,4552672,"It's yours, John. As you please."
