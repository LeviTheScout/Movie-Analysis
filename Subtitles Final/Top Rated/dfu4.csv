2,197948,199199,Hello.
3,200158,202828,My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.
4,208375,210419,Do you want a chocolate?
5,213004,216425,"I could eat about
a million and a half of these."
6,217592,222806,"My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates."
7,224808,227686,You never know what you're gonna get.
8,234901,237446,Those must be comfortable shoes.
9,238822,243493,"I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing."
10,245704,248165,I wish I had shoes like that.
11,248832,250375,My feet hurt.
12,251585,253253,Mama always said there's an awful lot
13,253336,256548,"you could tell about a person
by their shoes:"
14,257674,260635,"where they're going,
where they've been."
15,267893,269936,I've worn lots of shoes.
16,273064,277861,"I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes."
17,280781,283408,Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
18,284201,286828,She said they was my magic shoes.
19,286912,290081,"All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now."
20,297380,299841,Let's take a little walk around.
21,306640,308433,How do those feel?
22,311394,313563,"His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,"
23,313647,316149,"as strong as I've ever seen,"
24,316233,319611,"but his back is as crooked
as a politician."
25,320904,323990,"But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?"
26,324074,325200,Forrest!
27,326701,327911,"FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,"
28,327994,330831,"Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,"
29,330914,333333,General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
30,333416,335627,"She said we was related to him
in some way."
31,335710,337087,"And what he did was,"
32,337170,341424,"he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan."
33,341508,344845,"They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets"
34,344928,349266,"and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something."
35,349349,353228,"They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around."
36,353311,356356,"And anyway, that's how I got my name,"
37,356439,357858,Forrest Gump.
38,357941,359693,"Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part"
39,359776,363321,"was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,"
40,363405,366199,"well, just don't make no sense."
41,366658,367659,(CLANG)
42,371872,375375,"Okay... Get it, get it..."
43,375458,378420,"Wait, is it this way? Hold on."
44,379337,380839,All right...
45,381423,383091,What are you all staring at?
46,383174,387637,"Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?"
47,389180,392893,"Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest."
48,392976,395562,"If God intended
everybody to be the same,"
49,395645,397772,"he'd have given us all braces
on our legs."
50,397856,399566,"FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things"
51,399649,401651,so I could understand them.
52,403111,406615,"We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,"
53,406698,409743,"about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama."
54,409826,412579,That's in the county of Greenbow.
55,412662,417083,"Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa"
56,417167,419085,"had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,"
57,419169,421087,something like that.
58,421171,423882,"Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,"
59,423965,426718,"Mama decided to let those rooms out,"
60,426801,428762,"mostly to people passing through,"
61,428845,432807,"like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that."
62,432891,435602,That's how me and Mama got money.
63,435685,438438,Mama was a real smart lady.
64,438521,443526,"Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is."
65,446029,448406,"Did you hear what I said, Forrest?"
66,448490,452661,"You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different."
67,453161,457624,"Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump."
68,457707,459918,"Now, his IQ is 75."
69,460710,463838,"Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock."
70,467425,469469,"FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,"
71,469552,473473,"so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School."
72,473556,475809,I met the principal and all.
73,476309,479187,"I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump."
74,479646,482524,"Now, this is normal."
75,483024,486319,Forrest is right here.
76,487153,492701,"The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump."
77,493201,496079,"He's gonna have to go
to a special school."
78,496162,498289,"Now, he'll be just fine."
79,499082,501167,"What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?"
80,501251,504629,"He might be a bit on the slow side,"
81,505755,507507,but my boy Forrest is gonna get
82,507590,510135,"the same opportunities
as everyone else."
83,510218,514014,"He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires."
84,514097,517267,"We're talking about
five little points here."
85,518977,521604,There must be something can be done.
86,523189,525650,We're a progressive school system.
87,526484,529404,"We don't want to see anybody
left behind."
88,530280,533742,"Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
89,536995,538872,He's on vacation.
90,539873,542625,(GASPING AND PANTING)
91,556347,560143,"Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son."
92,565648,568109,"You don't say much, do you?"
93,571488,574657,(GASPING AND PANTING)
94,579621,581581,"""Finally, he had to try."
95,581664,583625,"""It looked easy, but,"
96,584834,587170,"""oh, what happened."
97,587253,590256,"- ""First, there...""
- Mama, what's ""vacation"" mean?"
98,590799,593384,"- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went."
99,596012,598723,Vacation's when you go somewhere
100,601101,603436,and you don't ever come back.
101,607774,611569,"FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own."
102,612779,616407,"But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty."
103,616491,619077,"There was always folks
coming and going."
104,619160,620245,MRS. GUMP: Supper.
105,620328,623748,"- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special."
106,623832,626376,"FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us"
107,626459,629129,"that every room
was filled with travelers."
108,629212,632841,"You know, folks living out
of their suitcases"
109,632924,635885,and hat cases and sample cases.
110,635969,639389,"Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest..."
111,639472,642016,"One time, a young man
was staying with us,"
112,642100,645728,and he had him a guitar case.
113,653862,656698,(SINGING HOUND DOG)
114,659701,663705,"Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man."
115,663788,665123,"ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am."
116,665206,668042,"I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here."
117,668126,671087,"All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat."
118,671171,674132,"Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am."
119,674799,678386,"Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there."
120,678469,680346,Slow it down some.
121,680555,682390,(SINGING HOUND DOG)
122,682473,684392,FORREST: I liked that guitar.
123,685059,686811,It sounded good.
124,688605,692775,"I started moving around to the music,"
125,692859,694694,swinging my hips.
126,697280,699824,"This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,"
127,699908,702911,"and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,"
128,702994,704579,and guess what?
129,706039,709334,(SINGING HOUND DOG)
130,716925,719761,This is not for children's eyes.
131,722305,724098,"Some years later,
that handsome young man"
132,724182,726726,"who they called ""The King,"""
133,726809,729145,"well, he'd sung too many songs,"
134,729812,732357,"had himself a heart attack,
or something."
135,733441,735610,Must be hard being a king.
136,739906,742742,"You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't."
137,743493,747372,"- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama."
138,749082,753670,"FORREST: I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well."
139,757215,758925,Are you coming along?
140,759008,762512,"Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers."
141,762595,764764,This is the bus to school.
142,767725,769978,I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
143,770937,774941,"- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore."
144,787954,789747,This seat's taken.
145,792208,793710,It's taken!
146,801592,803469,You can't sit here.
147,805638,809058,"FORREST: You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,"
148,809142,811519,'cause I don't remember being born.
149,813146,815315,"I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,"
150,815398,818484,"and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic."
151,818568,823281,But I do remember the first time I heard
152,823364,826200,the sweetest voice in the wide world.
153,826701,829078,JENNY: You can sit here if you want.
154,831998,835877,"I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life."
155,836586,838671,She was like an angel.
156,838755,841674,"Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?"
157,846637,848431,What's wrong with your legs?
158,848514,852769,"Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy."
159,853686,855855,I just sat next to her on that bus
160,855938,858024,"and had a conversation
all the way to school."
161,858107,860818,"...my back's crooked like
a question mark."
162,860902,862070,These are going to make me...
163,862153,866908,"And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions."
164,867450,869410,Are you stupid or something?
165,869494,872497,"Mama says, ""Stupid is as stupid does."""
166,874123,877794,"- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump."
167,878461,880296,"From that day on,
we was always together."
168,880380,883216,"Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots."
169,886803,888429,She taught me how to climb.
170,888513,891224,"Come on, Forrest, you can do it."
171,891307,893935,I showed her how to dangle.
172,894018,896062,"""...a good little monkey and..."""
173,896145,901067,"She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing."
174,903403,907156,"Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars."
175,907240,912161,"- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer."
176,913413,917166,"For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home."
177,917250,919335,"Okay, Jenny, I'll stay."
178,920169,922922,She was my most special friend.
179,926342,928010,My only friend.
180,931806,935601,"Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day."
181,935685,938062,"Some people don't think so, but they do."
182,941107,942692,"Hey, dummy!"
183,943651,945736,"Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?"
184,945820,949323,"- ""Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.""
- JENNY: Just run away, Forrest."
185,950658,953744,"Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!"
186,953828,957081,"- Get the bikes!
- BOY 1: Hurry up! Let's get him!"
187,957165,959709,"- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!"
188,959792,961627,We're gonna get you!
189,962587,966340,"Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!"
190,968050,969969,"Come back here, you!"
191,983608,986068,"Run, Forrest!"
192,986152,987570,Run!
193,1018768,1021646,"FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,"
194,1022772,1025274,but I can run like the wind blows.
195,1028528,1031614,"From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,"
196,1032448,1033741,I was running!
197,1033824,1036202,BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him!
198,1067650,1070653,That boy sure is a running fool.
199,1074865,1076242,"Now, remember how I told you that"
200,1076325,1079245,"Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?"
201,1079328,1082415,"Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama."
202,1082498,1084667,"Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,"
203,1084750,1088087,"and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer."
204,1089922,1090965,Jenny?
205,1091048,1093217,He was a very loving man.
206,1093676,1097930,"He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters."
207,1099682,1104103,"And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school."
208,1105271,1107231,"Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?"
209,1107315,1108316,(SHUSHES)
210,1108399,1110276,Daddy's taking a nap.
211,1110359,1112069,"- MR. CURRAN: Jenny!
- Come on!"
212,1113529,1116073,"MR. CURRAN:
Jenny, where'd you run to?"
213,1117408,1120077,"You'd better get back here, girl!"
214,1121537,1123205,Where you at?
215,1126584,1129879,Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?
216,1132882,1134216,Jenny!
217,1134300,1137261,"Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me."
218,1137386,1138512,MR. CURRAN: Jenny!
219,1138596,1141807,"Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,"
220,1141891,1143643,"far, far away from here."
221,1143726,1147396,"Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,"
222,1147480,1148606,"far, far away from here."
223,1148731,1151776,"Mama always said
that God is mysterious."
224,1151901,1153027,Jenny!
225,1153110,1155446,He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.
226,1155571,1156656,You'd better get back here!
227,1156739,1158240,"Instead,"
228,1158908,1163454,"he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more."
229,1163913,1167625,"She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,"
230,1167750,1170920,"which made me happy,
'cause she was so close."
231,1173506,1178552,"Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,"
232,1178636,1181764,just 'cause she said she was scared.
233,1181847,1184308,"Scared of what, I don't know,"
234,1184433,1187645,but I think it was her grandma's dog.
235,1187770,1189522,He was a mean dog.
236,1190272,1192983,"Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends"
237,1193067,1194360,all the way up through high school.
238,1196320,1198364,"- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!"
239,1199490,1201784,"- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,"
240,1202493,1203953,"did you hear me, stupid?"
241,1204036,1205246,"- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!"
242,1205329,1207456,BOY 1: Get in the truck! Let's move it!
243,1207540,1210292,"Come on, he's getting away! Move it!"
244,1210376,1212545,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
245,1212628,1216173,"BOY 2: You better be running, stupid!
BOY 1: Come on, dummy!"
246,1218134,1221637,"- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!"
247,1224640,1226308,Jack rabbit!
248,1232982,1234650,(BOYS LAUGHING)
249,1234734,1235985,Yeah!
250,1236819,1238988,Go! Go! Go!
251,1240698,1242324,"Run, Forrest!"
252,1245327,1248914,"Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,"
253,1250499,1253002,"I never thought it would
take me anywhere."
254,1255880,1258466,(BOYS WHOOPING)
255,1282031,1286202,"- Who in the hell is that?

we prayed, Forrest?"
507,2316439,2320944,"We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?"
508,2322904,2324280,"Yes, I do."
509,2328243,2331079,You think I could fly off this bridge?

something, okay?"

was gonna be very different"
531,2480603,2483481,from the United States of America.
532,2483564,2488611,"And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was."
533,2498746,2501833,"Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters."
534,2501916,2505086,"They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers."
535,2505169,2508715,"You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,"

and learn from the guys"
555,2562894,2565563,"who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right."
556,2565646,2567565,There is one item of GI gear
557,2567648,2571819,"that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt."
558,2572153,2575323,"Socks. Cushion sole, OD green."

560,2576824,2578242,"When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember"
561,2578326,2580787,to change your socks whenever we stop.
562,2580870,2583831,"The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs."
563,2583915,2586209,"Sergeant Sims, God damn it,"
564,2586334,2587752,"where is that sling rope
I told you to order?"
565,2587835,2589754,I put in the requisitions at Battalion.
566,2589837,2591839,"DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again..."
567,2591923,2594467,"FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff."
568,2594550,2596844,I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.
569,2597595,2601057,"He was from a long,
great military tradition."
570,2601265,2604352,"Somebody in his family
had fought and died"
571,2605353,2609607,in every single American war.
572,2610525,2612527,"- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant."
573,2612610,2613736,Get on it!
574,2613861,2617198,"I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to."
575,2618908,2623746,"So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there."
576,2623871,2626040,Little Rock's a fine town.
577,2626707,2630294,"Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,"
578,2630378,2632839,draw what you need for the field.
579,2632922,2636884,"If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here."
580,2636968,2639846,Two standing orders in this platoon:
581,2639929,2642598,"one, take good care of your feet,"
582,2642723,2647770,"two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed."
583,2654235,2656320,I sure hope I don't let him down.
584,2667915,2670418,"FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside."
585,2670501,2672837,We would take these real long walks.
586,2681304,2685433,"And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie."
587,2693274,2695526,"DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!"
588,2698362,2700698,It wasn't always fun.
589,2700781,2705077,"Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,"
590,2705161,2710249,"or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up..."
591,2710333,2712335,Get down! Shut up!
592,2713294,2714754,(WHISPERING) ...so we did.
593,2732313,2734482,"Now, I don't know much about anything,"
594,2734565,2738402,"but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war."
595,2738486,2741197,"There was Dallas, from Phoenix,"
596,2742907,2745701,"Cleveland, he was from Detroit."
597,2745826,2748204,"(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex."
598,2748329,2750498,"Man, what the hell's going on?"
599,2750581,2754919,"And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from."
600,2755002,2756545,DAN: Nothing.
601,2760675,2763177,"Fourth Platoon, on your feet."
602,2763261,2766973,"Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out."
603,2767056,2768849,"Come on, move out."
604,2770893,2773312,Step it up. Look alive out there.
605,2773396,2777733,"The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go."
606,2777858,2779235,DAN: Fire in the hole!
607,2782697,2785032,"Gump, check out that hole."
608,2785116,2788119,And there was always something to do.
609,2788202,2791372,"- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back."
610,2796419,2802049,"One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months."
611,2803050,2805928,"We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:"
612,2806053,2808597,"little bitty stinging rain,"
613,2809307,2811976,"and big old fat rain,"
614,2812435,2815146,rain that flew in sideways.
615,2815229,2819275,"And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath."
616,2821068,2823446,"Shoot, it even rained at night."
617,2824488,2826949,"- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba."
618,2827074,2830369,"I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me."
619,2830453,2834290,"This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud."
620,2835249,2838711,"You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?"
621,2838794,2841297,"'Cause we be watching out
for one another,"
622,2841422,2843299,like brothers and stuff.
623,2845259,2848929,"Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about."
624,2849013,2852016,"I got a very important question
to ask you."
625,2853642,2857605,"How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?"
626,2858773,2860399,Okay.
627,2860483,2863944,"Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too."
628,2864028,2866822,"So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,"
629,2866947,2870242,"so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat."
630,2870326,2872620,We ain't got to pay no rent.
631,2872703,2874789,"I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,"
632,2874872,2879126,"split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50."
633,2879210,2882797,"And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat."
634,2884340,2886133,That's a fine idea.
635,2887218,2889345,FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.
636,2893140,2896227,"I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it."
637,2897019,2900231,"I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost."
638,2900314,2905319,"I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,"
639,2905403,2908155,"and told her
how I thought about her always,"
640,2909490,2912451,"and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her"
641,2912535,2915037,just as soon as she had the time.
642,2916914,2919417,I'd always let her know that I was okay.
643,2920709,2925881,"Then, I'd sign each letter,
""Love, Forrest Gump."""
644,2940729,2944483,"This one day, we was out walking,
like always,"
645,2944567,2947528,"and then, just like that,"
646,2948446,2951866,"somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out."

730,3334581,3337709,"DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!"
731,3338752,3343257,"If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,"
732,3343382,3345676,I'd of thought of something better to say.
733,3345759,3347261,"Hey, Bubba."
734,3348387,3349763,"Hey, Forrest."
735,3352099,3355310,"Forrest, why'd this happen?"
736,3356645,3358438,You got shot.
737,3360148,3364319,"Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget."
738,3365112,3366780,I wanna go home.
739,3368782,3370826,Bubba was my best good friend.
740,3371785,3376331,"And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner."
741,3376456,3379543,"Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,"
742,3379626,3383589,"but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam."
743,3389303,3391597,That's all I have to say about that.
744,3393974,3396143,"It was a bullet, wasn't it?"
745,3398478,3401148,"- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you."
746,3403525,3405611,"Oh, yes, sir."
747,3405694,3408822,Bit me directly in the buttocks.
748,3408947,3414202,"They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,"
749,3414328,3418165,"'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars."
750,3418999,3422502,"The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks"
751,3422628,3424338,is the ice cream.
752,3424463,3427049,"They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat."
753,3427174,3428467,And guess what?
754,3428550,3431678,"A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door."
755,3433889,3436975,"Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream."
756,3439353,3441521,"Lieutenant Dan, ice cream."

774,3535949,3541788,"no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball."
775,3545375,3546710,All right.
776,3550047,3553717,"For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me."
777,3554051,3556970,See? Any idiot can play.
778,3557471,3560223,"So, I started playing it all the time."
779,3561391,3562726,I played Ping-Pong
780,3562809,3566104,"even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with."
781,3574154,3578825,"The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,"
782,3578950,3580786,whatever that means.
783,3581244,3584498,"Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play."
784,3590003,3593882,"I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep."
785,3601681,3606770,"Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny."
786,3606853,3609898,"Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan."
787,3610023,3612692,"I should have died out there
with my men,"
788,3612818,3616780,"but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,"
789,3616863,3620492,a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!
790,3621243,3622327,Do you see that?
791,3622410,3626206,"Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?"
792,3629543,3631169,"Yes, sir, I do."
793,3634840,3636883,Did you hear what I said?
794,3637759,3639511,You cheated me.
795,3639594,3640762,I had a destiny.
796,3640846,3644391,"I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!"
797,3645058,3649104,"That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!"
798,3658738,3661449,"Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?"
799,3663577,3666955,"This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me."
800,3669583,3671251,I had a destiny.
801,3673211,3677591,I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
802,3683763,3686099,You're still Lieutenant Dan.
803,3709331,3710832,Look at me.
804,3712167,3714127,What am I gonna do now?

807,3733230,3734648,"Yes, sir!"
808,3735315,3736816,As you were.
809,3737317,3741154,"Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor."
810,3742197,3745825,"Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a..."
811,3752582,3756336,"Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?"
812,3757254,3759047,They sent him home.
813,3765053,3767806,"FORREST:

ropes and new nets"

did come up with an idea for a T-shirt."
1427,7037948,7040325,He made a lot of money off of it.
1428,7043119,7047541,"Anyway, like I was saying,

goes to bed down on the bayou."

a million sparkles on the water."

It was so clear, Jenny,"
1542,7708951,7713539,"it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other."
1543,7716083,7719128,"And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,"
1544,7721589,7725760,I couldn't tell where heaven stopped
1545,7726302,7728679,and the earth began.

1550,7760670,7764006,You died on a Saturday morning.
1551,7765716,7769470,"And I had you placed
here under our tree."
1552,7774350,7779188,"And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground."
1553,7783317,7784986,Mama
1554,7786070,7791075,always said that dying was a part of life.
1555,7794495,7796831,I sure wish it wasn't.
1556,7799500,7803254,Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1558,7805923,7808592,"About to start school again soon,"
1559,7810428,7814223,"and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day."
1560,7816392,7822398,"I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day."
1561,7825526,7828112,Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.
1562,7829405,7830448,Okay.
1563,7830698,7831866,He's really good.
1564,7831949,7834076,"Forrest, you go."
1565,7838289,7839874,We fish a lot.
1566,7843419,7846881,"(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny."
1567,7850134,7852386,You'd be so proud of him.
1568,7854096,7855556,I am.
1569,7856599,7859810,He wrote you a letter.
1570,7861395,7863439,And he says I can't read it.
1571,7863564,7867109,"I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you."
1572,7883167,7884502,"Jenny,"
1573,7890299,7893511,"I don't know if Mama was right,"
1574,7894845,7896347,or if it's Lieutenant Dan.
1575,7896472,7899058,I don't know
1576,7899141,7903646,"if we each have a destiny,"
1577,7905689,7910820,"or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze."
1578,7915324,7917159,But I think
1579,7919036,7920830,maybe it's both.
1580,7925167,7928045,"Maybe both is happening
at the same time."
1581,7934176,7936178,"But I miss you, Jenny."
1582,7942560,7946981,"If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away."
1583,7982266,7985227,Here's your bus. Okay.
1584,7986896,7990232,Hey. I know this.
1585,7990357,7993235,"I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because"
1586,7993360,7996030,Grandma used to read it to you.
1587,7996113,7998240,My favorite book.
1588,8001577,8003078,Here we are.
1589,8003245,8004705,Okay.

1591,8012796,8015299,"Hey, Forrest, don't..."
1592,8018761,8022473,"- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy."
1593,8024475,8027269,I'll be right here when you get back.
1594,8031815,8035069,"You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?"
1595,8035152,8038697,"Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump."
