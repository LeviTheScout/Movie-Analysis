9,49467,51426,Much that once was...
10,51510,53136,is lost.
11,53804,56848,For none now live who remember it.
12,69779,74157,"It began with the forging
of the Great Rings."
13,74408,76368,Three were given to the Elves:
14,76452,80288,"Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings."
15,81332,83416,Seven to the Dwarf-lords:
16,84168,88588,"Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls."
17,89048,90382,And nine...
18,90466,93593,"nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men..."
19,93678,97555,"who, above all else, desire power."
20,99225,103895,"For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race."
21,105398,108566,But they were all of them deceived.
22,108818,110902,For another ring was made.
23,112280,115323,"In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom..."
24,115741,120287,"the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring..."
25,120371,122539,to control all others.
26,122623,126710,"And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice..."
27,126794,131047,and his will to dominate all life.
28,132008,135885,One Ring to rule them all.
29,136721,138471,One by one...
30,138556,143351,"the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring."
31,143436,146521,But there were some who resisted.
32,146981,151735,"A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor."
33,151819,156489,"And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth."

36,186812,189439,Victory was near.
37,194195,195945,But the power of the Ring...
38,196781,198198,could not be undone.
39,222807,224808,It was in this moment...
40,224892,227394,when all hope had faded...
41,227478,231648,"that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword."
42,262721,269227,"Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated."
43,276110,278361,The Ring passed to Isildur...
44,278446,282699,"who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever."
45,283409,285618,But the hearts of Men...
46,285703,288246,are easily corrupted.
47,288497,293126,"And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own."
48,318319,320945,It betrayed Isildur...
49,322781,325200,to his death.
50,329371,333333,"And some things
that should not have been forgotten..."
51,333417,335793,were lost.
52,336629,338922,History became legend...
53,339006,341132,legend became myth.
54,341217,344177,"And for
two and a half thousand years..."
55,344261,348014,"the Ring passed
out of all knowledge."
56,348641,351476,"Until, when chance came..."
57,352144,355271,it ensnared a new bearer.

59,361695,364280,"FEMALE VOICE: The Ring came
to the creature Gollum..."
60,364365,368326,"who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains."
61,368619,371496,And there it consumed him.
62,371747,373873,"GOLLUM:

66,390558,394519,For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

it waited."
68,399400,402694,"Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world."
69,402945,405863,Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...
70,405948,408866,whispers of a nameless fear.
71,408951,412370,And the Ring of Power perceived...
72,412454,415290,its time had now come.
73,417710,420378,It abandoned Gollum.
74,421046,425550,"But something happened then

512,2511176,2513969,"You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you."
513,2514262,2516764,"That name is not safe
outside the Shire."

Have you been eavesdropping?"
525,2558390,2562977,"I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window."
526,2563061,2565604,"A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?"
527,2565689,2568691,"- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!"
528,2568775,2569859,Nothing important.
529,2570444,2574613,"That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but..."
530,2574698,2579493,"Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural."
531,2580162,2581829,No?
532,2582998,2584165,Perhaps not.
533,2585375,2588836,I've thought of a better use for you.

it was in the Shire."

- Yet you did not have the wit to see it."
585,2857689,2862192,"Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind."
586,2863069,2867114,"But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly."
587,2867198,2868699,Time?
588,2869617,2872244,What time do you think we have?
589,2872704,2876623,"Sauron has regained
much of his former strength."
590,2876708,2878959,He cannot yet take physical form...
591,2879210,2881920,"but his spirit has lost
none of its potency."

601,2918833,2920334,How?
602,2920960,2922628,I have seen it.
603,2923046,2926256,"A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman."
604,2926966,2928467,Why?
605,2928927,2931637,Why should we fear to use it?
606,2934265,2938227,"They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones."
607,2938311,2941605,"We do not know who else
may be watching."
608,2944192,2946985,The hour is later than you think.
609,2947070,2949446,Sauron's forces are already moving.
610,2951699,2954451,The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
611,2954828,2955911,The Nine?

615,2967715,2969967,And kill the one who carries it.
616,2970468,2971969,Frodo!
617,2984566,2988986,"You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?"
618,2989737,2992531,There are none who can.
619,2995034,2997786,Against the power of Mordor...
620,2997871,3000581,there can be no victory.
621,3002542,3005711,"We must join with him, Gandalf."
622,3007005,3009339,We must join with Sauron.
623,3012010,3014678,"It would be wise, my friend."

abandon reason for madness?"

628,3065730,3068440,of aiding me willingly...

And I don't mean to."

- He's been following us for three days."
1311,7643538,7647708,"- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped..."

1313,7650545,7654214,Now the Ring has brought him here.
1314,7656843,7659595,He will never be rid of his need for it.
1315,7659762,7665517,"He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself."
1316,7665685,7670564,Sméagol's life is a sad story.
1317,7670732,7676695,"Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him."
1318,7677614,7680407,Before it drove him mad.
1319,7680700,7683577,"It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance."
1320,7683745,7684953,Pity?
1321,7686039,7688916,It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
1322,7689834,7695047,"Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life."
1323,7696466,7698967,"Can you give it to them, Frodo?"
1324,7701387,7705349,"Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment."
1325,7705558,7708477,"Even the very wise
cannot see all ends."
1326,7709062,7714983,"My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill..."

1328,7720114,7723992,"The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many."
1329,7730625,7734002,"I wish the Ring
had never come to me."
1330,7735421,7737464,I wish none of this had happened.
1331,7737632,7742678,"So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide."
1332,7743513,7749017,"All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us."
1333,7750520,7754523,"There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil."
1334,7754899,7757317,Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
1335,7757819,7762155,"In which case,
you also were meant to have it."
1336,7762323,7765534,And that is an encouraging thought.
1337,7768454,7769621,Ah!
1338,7770415,7772332,It's that way.

1695,10606540,10610292,"Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old."
1696,10611044,10612962,My kin.
1697,10691958,10694126,We cross the lake at nightfall.
1698,10694377,10696962,Hide the boats and continue on foot.
1699,10697130,10700633,"- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?"
1700,10701051,10704887,"Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil..."
1701,10705055,10708307,"an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks."
1702,10708475,10711602,"And after that, it gets even better."
1703,10711978,10716941,"Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see."
1704,10717108,10718484,That is our road.
1705,10720070,10723280,"I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf."
1706,10723490,10725240,Recover my...
1707,10728244,10730245,"- We should leave now.
- No."
1708,10730413,10734875,"Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness."
1709,10735085,10738504,"It is not the eastern shore
that worries me."
1710,10738755,10742758,"A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind."
1711,10743259,10747429,"Something draws near.
I can feel it."
1712,10749432,10754395,"Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit."
1713,10754896,10756605,Where's Frodo?
1714,10782215,10784133,"BOROMIR:
None of us should wander alone."
1715,10785552,10787636,"You, least of all."
1716,10787846,10790305,So much depends on you.
1717,10791349,10793308,Frodo?
1718,10800442,10802985,I know why you seek solitude.
1719,10803695,10807156,You suffer. I see it day by day.
1720,10807949,10810993,You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
1721,10812579,10815205,"There are other ways, Frodo."
1722,10815457,10819251,"- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say."
1723,10819502,10823255,"It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart."
1724,10823506,10826592,Warning? Against what?
1725,10826760,10828886,"We're all afraid, Frodo."
1726,10829095,10832723,"But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have..."
1727,10832974,10836727,"- don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way."
1728,10838521,10841857,"I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!"
1729,10843401,10845486,"- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No."
1730,10846696,10850365,"- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself."
1731,10852202,10855537,What chance do you think you have?
1732,10855705,10860375,"They will find you.
They will take the Ring."
1733,10860627,10864296,"And you will beg for death
before the end!"
1734,10866424,10868550,You fool!
1735,10868718,10872721,"It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine."
1736,10872889,10875724,It should be mine! Give it to me!
1737,10875892,10877226,"- Give it to me!
- No!"
1738,10877393,10879228,"- Give it to me!
- No."
1739,10886903,10888904,I see your mind.
1740,10889155,10892074,You will take the Ring to Sauron!
1741,10892283,10894159,You will betray us!
1742,10894410,10897579,"You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!"
1743,10898039,10901667,"Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!"
1744,10908758,10910259,Frodo?
1745,10914597,10916181,Frodo.
1746,10920103,10922104,What have I done?
1747,10922313,10924064,"Please, Frodo."
1748,10924274,10926942,"Frodo, I'm sorry!"
1749,10927152,10929027,Frodo!
1750,10954304,10957639,"[IN BLACK SPEECH] A'ghi Gûr'ruzh
They will fall."
1751,10975491,10976909,Frodo?
1752,10978161,10981246,"- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?"
1753,10981497,10983248,Stay away!
1754,10983666,10985250,Frodo!
1755,10987503,10991340,"- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?"
1756,11001017,11003518,Would you destroy it?
1757,11008524,11010442,"VOICE OF THE RING:
Aragorn."
1758,11013863,11016198,Aragorn.
1759,11018034,11019868,Elessar.
1760,11027543,11030879,I would have gone with you to the end.
1761,11031547,11034383,Into the very fires of Mordor.
1762,11037720,11038887,I know.
1763,11041391,11046812,"Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand."
1764,11050566,11052317,"Go, Frodo!"
1765,11055321,11056822,Run.
1766,11057073,11058740,Run!
1767,11083266,11084933,Mr. Frodo!
1768,11094235,11100157,Find the halfling!
1769,11103619,11105287,Elendil!
1770,11111794,11113378,"Aragorn, go!"
1771,11135068,11136401,"PIPPIN:
Frodo!"
1772,11136986,11138570,Hide here. Quick!
1773,11139197,11140655,Come on!
1774,11143159,11145160,What's he doing?
1775,11149415,11151416,He's leaving.
1776,11156172,11159091,"- No!
- Pippin!"
1777,11164013,11166348,"MERRY:
Run, Frodo. Go on!"
1778,11166933,11170018,"- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!"
1779,11170436,11172020,"- Over here!
- This way!"
1780,11182865,11185200,"- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!"
1781,11238671,11240297,[HORN BLOWS]
1782,11240590,11243633,"- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir."
1783,11286719,11287844,Run!
1784,11384609,11387027,[ARROW HITS]
1785,11499432,11501057,No.
1786,11504895,11507939,"- They took the little ones.
- Hold still."
1787,11508274,11510358,Frodo. Where is Frodo?
1788,11512236,11513653,I let Frodo go.
1789,11514363,11516948,Then you did what I could not.
1790,11517950,11521286,I tried to take the Ring from him.
1791,11521787,11526082,"- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me."
1792,11526292,11528585,I did not see it.
1793,11528794,11531963,"- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir."
1794,11532423,11534966,You fought bravely.
1795,11535259,11537927,You have kept your honor.
1796,11538471,11540430,"BOROMIR:
Leave it."
1797,11540765,11542807,It is over.
1798,11543976,11549272,"The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness..."
1799,11549690,11552692,and my city to ruin.
1800,11556781,11559491,"I do not know what strength
is in my blood..."
1801,11559658,11563661,"but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall..."
1802,11564663,11567165,nor our people fail.
1803,11568167,11575465,Our people.
1804,11597196,11600198,"I would have followed you, my brother."
1805,11601742,11603743,My captain.
1806,11606372,11608331,My king.
1807,11627977,11630228,Be at peace...
1808,11630563,11632564,son of Gondor.
1809,11649081,11652417,"They will look for his coming
from the White Tower."
1810,11652918,11655920,But he will not return.
1811,11679111,11681112,Frodo!
1812,11700591,11703843,"FRODO:
I wish the Ring had never come to me."
1813,11705137,11708139,I wish none of this had happened.
1814,11711101,11713853,"GANDALF: So do all who live
to see such times..."
1815,11714063,11717482,but that is not for them to decide.
1816,11717650,11720318,All you have to decide...
1817,11720569,11725323,"is what to do with the time
that is given to you."
1818,11754144,11756187,"Frodo, no!"
1819,11756689,11758022,Frodo!
1820,11758857,11761526,"- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam."
1821,11765030,11767031,"Go back, Sam!"
1822,11767533,11771119,"- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are."
1823,11771328,11774163,And I'm coming with you!
1824,11774623,11777041,You can't swim!
1825,11780838,11788838,Sam!
1826,11830387,11833097,"I made a promise, Mr. Frodo."
1827,11833432,11837769,"A promise:
""Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."""
1828,11838896,11841481,And I don't mean to.
1829,11841774,11843941,I don't mean to.
1830,11845611,11847445,Sam.
1831,11862294,11863961,Come on.
1832,11892449,11896994,"Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore."
1833,11911844,11916848,"- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands."
1834,11920310,11925189,"Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed."
1835,11937035,11940204,Not if we hold true to each other.
1836,11941540,11946043,"We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death."
1837,11947045,11952300,"Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind."
1838,11953552,11955595,We travel light.
1839,11955804,11957722,Let us hunt some Orc.
1840,11960684,11962727,Yes!
1841,11981705,11983122,"FRODO:
Mordor."
1842,11983749,11987126,I hope the others find a safer road.
1843,11988086,11990630,Strider will look after them.
1844,11991590,11994926,"I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again."
1845,11995260,11997720,"We may yet, Mr. Frodo."
1846,11997930,11999430,We may.
1847,12001558,12002600,Sam...
1848,12006230,12008856,I'm glad you are with me.
