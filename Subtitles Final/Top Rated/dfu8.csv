I need at least eight people."

35,194081,196164,"Why has nobody come to receive them, sir?"
36,197831,199039,Are they orphans?
37,199164,200164,You could say that.
38,200289,202289,"Send them away. Don't let them dawdle.
-What?"
39,202414,203414,Clear them out!
40,204831,206456,Twelve guys in all.
41,206581,209289,"Six from Koravars.
Four Irulas. Two from Ottar."
42,209414,211706,"They are drawing attention.
Get them away quick."
43,211831,214247,"Plenty of pending cases.
We'll need at least six."
44,214372,216997,"We're under pressure too!
The Inspector himself is here!"
45,217122,218331,He's due for a promotion.
46,218456,219997,We need to wrap up pending cases soon.
47,220122,222581,"We're answerable to higher-ups too.
Split them fairly!"
48,225039,227622,"As if the law says you can file
only one case against someone!"
49,227747,230789,"Slap at least two cases on each guy.
Like anyone will question it!"
50,230914,234206,"As if these guys will admit to it
right away. Like you know our troubles..."
51,234331,235372,Get in!
52,235497,237497,Everyone get in!
53,237622,240247,"Thought you were freeing us,
but now you load us back in there?"
54,240372,242872,"Don't hit me, sir.
My wife and children are here."
55,242997,245914,"Get inside.
-I didn't do anything."
56,246039,247039,"Get in, I say!"
57,247164,249872,"I am as good as dead, dad!
-Dear boy..."
58,249997,251747,Don't forsake my wife and child.
59,251872,254039,The cops won't let me live anymore.
60,254164,255497,Take care of my family.
61,255622,256956,"Grab him, Constable sir."

67,326414,327414,Make it fast.
68,328122,329581,"I'm coming.
Hold on."
69,329706,331247,"Hurry up, Irutappa.
-I'm coming."
70,331372,332414,"Here you go.
-Give me."
71,336414,337497,Blow in.
72,344831,347164,"What are you doing? Blow harder.
-Wait. I'll do it."
73,348372,350372,"So much smoke
and still these don't come out."
74,350497,352039,Let's see who wins today!
75,362414,364372,"They are coming out, dear.
-Catch them."
76,364497,365831,Catch them all.
77,368997,371247,"Got them.
Look how many rats are in here!"
78,371372,372414,Get them.
79,372539,374456,"Dig deeper, Irutappa.
-Got it."
80,376581,377997,"Okay, dearie..."
81,379497,380706,It's okay...
82,380831,381997,"That's it.
Run along!"
83,382122,384456,"Crackpot!
Letting the hard-caught rats go scot free?"
84,384581,388581,"It's a baby rat. Should we ease our hunger
with that little thing?"
85,388706,389789,"A young life?
-Yes."
86,389914,390914,Very well...
87,393289,394872,"Bring it here.
-Mosakutty!"
88,394997,396497,"I'll get the gunny bag!
-What is it?"
89,396622,398831,"I ask you to catch rats
and you dig a well instead?"
90,400122,402914,"What gives, Auntie?
Won't keep your brother in line?"
91,403039,405122,"You find it funny, eh?
-What else to do?"
92,405247,407122,"You keep digging
as if for treasure!"
93,407247,409706,"Won't I catch them if I find them?
-As if! Keep digging!"
94,411039,413622,"Watch how many rats I catch!
-I've been doing that for years!"
95,414497,416414,(An 80s film song plays on the radio)
96,418997,421539,"Are you here to listen to music?
Gather the grains!"
97,421664,423997,"The song refers to your name.
Why get worked up now?"
98,425164,426164,So that's how it goes?
99,426289,428456,"At this rate, you'll make a baby
right on this field."
100,428581,430914,"Wherever you wish,
I'll make a baby!"
101,431039,433872,"Born a huntress,
would I be afraid to bear a child?"
102,433997,436372,"Alright then.
Tonight's sure to be a sleepless one!"
103,438372,440581,"Oh my! All the grain
that's hidden here!"
104,440706,442331,"Dig it up.
-Here you go."
105,444167,445458,"It'll be all good, now."
106,452831,453831,Hey!
107,454581,455831,What is all this?
108,455956,458539,"We've caught all the rats, sir.
No more snake trouble for you."
109,458664,461206,"You've dug up the farm
like a damn flock of pigs!"
110,461331,462831,We'll fix it up before we leave.
111,462956,463956,"See to it.
-Yes, sir."
112,464081,465789,Big mistake letting you in the village!
113,465914,468414,"Offer a place to sit,
you'll ask for a place to lie down!"
114,469372,471414,"A riddle for you.
Crack it if you can."

You have to bend low to enter, right?"
119,480122,481622,Wrong answer!
120,481747,482914,Oh my!
121,483039,484122,"Come by home, brother!"
122,484247,486706,"No. Got sacks to haul at the rice mill.
-Heading there?"
123,486831,488706,"Alright.
Give a kiss to your uncle, Alli!"
124,488831,489831,"Alright.
-See you."

-Move, move!"
128,505414,507039,"Do you not hear me?
-What is it?"
129,508039,510539,"For the last time, are you coming?
-Shut up and sleep."
130,517039,518247,"Get over here.
-Let go."
131,521497,523539,Look... I've been calling for so long.
132,525456,526706,Why play hard to get?
133,526831,529456,"Must I work on you
like I do the smoke pot?"
134,529581,530622,"Here, bundle them up."
135,530747,533372,"The house is all damp
and you try out lame charms!"

137,536789,537789,What?
138,538497,542164,"I'll build you a brick house.
Hug me tight, won't you?"
139,542289,544956,"As it is, we live on the lake bund."
140,545081,548372,"You think officers are going to
let you build our house there?"
141,550581,551872,Get over here.
142,551997,555206,"First, fix that roof.
You can fantasize later."
143,558581,559664,My precious!
144,560956,562622,I swear upon you!

of a brick house!"

148,602206,604622,"I'm going to visit my daughter.
Be back in two months."
149,604747,606747,"Meet the head of the municipality.
-Yes, sir."
150,628585,630898,Oh heavens! A snake!
151,634622,636914,"How many bricks have I cut out
with these hands!"

one brick house of my own."

-Yes?"
154,641831,644622,"There's a snake at the house

-O dear Goddess..."
159,657664,659331,"Take this too. Eat it.
-Alright."
160,659456,660706,"See you.
-Be careful."
161,660831,662539,"If my uncle comes, have him fix it up."
162,662664,663747,"Let's go, brother."
163,667414,670747,"All the firewood got wet.
I'll put them out to dry."
164,675956,678497,"Run!
-Move aside, sister."
165,681331,683164,"Did it go in here?
-Right there."
166,683289,685497,"Come here.
It was there, wasn't it?"
167,685622,687081,That's where it went.
168,687206,689581,"Why leave the closet open like this,
you idiot?"
169,689706,692372,"I was way too panicked
to do anything!"
170,693497,694581,O Dear Goddess!
171,696706,698997,"Damn! I have to deal with this
ahead of the trip."
172,709747,711581,"Did he find it?
-I don't know."
173,713122,714206,Maybe he got it.
174,714997,715997,Sir?
175,721331,723747,"It's not here, sir.
Here's your earring, ma'am."
176,723872,726081,"Checked the jewellery closet?
-Hey!"
177,726206,729331,"How could it get in there?
-What if that damn snake bites me?"
178,729456,731164,You dunce!
179,753956,754956,"Come, come..."
180,757081,758831,That's it...
181,764793,765372,That's it.
182,765497,769331,"Of all places, you preferred
the President's house for feast, eh?"
183,769456,771289,Why the hell are you coddling it?
184,771414,774456,"Kill it and toss it away!
-What will this poor thing do, sir?"
185,774581,778581,"God smeared venom on its fangs
and it gets whacked everywhere it goes."
186,778706,780956,"If not for it,
this town will be infested with rats."
187,781081,784164,"I'll release it into the woods.
-Do whatever you want. Go!"
188,784289,786581,"Nothing to see here! Go away!
-Here you go."
189,789456,791581,"What the hell were you doing
all this while?"
190,791706,793956,"Couldn't you have gotten it started?
-I'll check."
191,794081,795497,"Give the car a push!
-Yes, sir!"
192,798872,800497,Will the car make it to town?
193,802706,803997,Stop.
194,804122,805539,"Come here.
-Alright!"
195,806331,807331,Yes?
196,808622,810122,"Here.
-Oh please, sir!"
197,810247,812331,"Why pay for a favour? No need.
-Alright."
198,812456,815039,"Moreover, ma'am comes from my village.
-From your village?"
199,815164,816872,"Next, you'll say I'm your relative!"
200,816997,818956,"Since when is your place
part of the village?"

about Tribe certificates and whatnot!"

-About my son's certificate...."

260,1007622,1010622,"You're going to have a little brother,
Alli!"

have honey from up the hill."
270,1059122,1060664,You'll live to be a hundred.
271,1060789,1061789,"Thank you.
-Alright."

303,1192456,1196164,"Only staying away from humans
will do you good! Got it?"
304,1197039,1198039,Get going.
305,1198164,1199581,'We are a band of hunters'
306,1199706,1201956,'We are a tribe of bowmen'
307,1206539,1208622,Have Durai's guys reached yet?
308,1208747,1211581,"They reached the kiln early yesterday.
-That soon?"
309,1211706,1214164,"When do we reach if we leave so late?
-We'll be in good time."
310,1214289,1216747,"I'll go with you, dear.
-Hey!"
311,1216872,1219081,Am I going to a faraway land?
312,1219206,1222789,"Will hunting squirrels and hares
and running behind you be enough?"
313,1222914,1224206,"Up to two kids now, right?"
314,1225039,1226456,How else do we earn?
315,1226581,1228247,Advance payment from the brick kiln.
316,1228372,1230956,"Go wherever.
But, take me with you."
317,1233247,1235122,Must you burn at the kiln's fire too?
318,1236372,1239456,"Burning there is nothing
compared to being away from you!"
319,1244122,1245747,Must the little one suffer too?
320,1248539,1249581,Look at me.
321,1250581,1252914,"Sengani!
Look at me!"
322,1254914,1258206,"If you come there as well,
Alli can't go to school."
323,1258331,1259747,Won't her studies be spoilt?
324,1261664,1263372,You take good care of the kids.
325,1263497,1265372,I'll earn our living.
326,1265497,1267914,"Are you coming or not, Rajakannu?
-On my way, brother."
327,1269914,1271872,"See me off
without these tears, Sengani."
328,1274456,1275456,I'll get going.
329,1276747,1277747,"Be safe, alright?"
330,1278956,1282247,"As if wed yesterday, they are standing
entwined like two snakes!"
331,1286164,1287206,Won't you smile?
332,1289081,1291122,"Shall I go?
Take care!"
333,1293831,1294956,Alli!
334,1295706,1298206,"Don't give your mother
any trouble."
335,1298331,1300956,"Go to school without tantrums.
-Alright, dad."
336,1301081,1302331,One for your dad?
337,1302456,1303664,Shall I go?
338,1304831,1306539,"Let's go, brother."
339,1306664,1308456,"About time!
-See you."
340,1308581,1310914,He won't leave his wife's side!
341,1311039,1312914,"Listen up, Ezhumalai!"
342,1313039,1315622,"Go to school without making a fuss!
-Alright, brother."
343,1317122,1318247,Take this.
344,1318997,1320164,"Study well.
-Alright."
345,1328122,1330081,"Quit looking back!
Just keep moving."
346,1356664,1359331,"""You can see the flowers.
But can't see the fruit."" What is it?"
347,1359456,1361414,See the flowers...
348,1361539,1363664,"Not see the fruit?
-Take a guess."
349,1363789,1364914,"I don't know, brother."
350,1365039,1366247,Think hard!
351,1367372,1369081,"Think it over!
-Alright!"
352,1369206,1370206,Coming through!
353,1373914,1376997,"Hey Rajakannu,
you slog away doing two people's work!"
354,1377122,1379622,"If you had brought your wife,
she'd have been of some help."
355,1379747,1382039,"What, she thinks herself a queen?"
356,1382164,1383872,My wife is indeed my queen!
357,1383997,1386122,"Expect me to have my pregnant wife
suffer here?"
358,1386247,1390331,"You are telling that to a woman
who birthed and raised eight kids here?"
359,1390456,1391747,"""Eight kids""?
-Yeah!"
360,1391872,1394497,"Your husband didn't work just the kiln,
did he?"
361,1412331,1414997,"Believe me, sir.
All of them are new voters."
362,1415122,1416956,None of them have cast a vote yet.
363,1417081,1420831,"When they don't even have ration cards,
how can they be added to the voters list?"
364,1420956,1422872,Don't they need a proof of residence?
365,1422997,1424581,Is that their fault?
366,1424706,1428497,"Nearly 50 years of independence, and
they don't even have proof of residence."
367,1428622,1432289,"Please speak to the Election Commission
and arrange something."
368,1432414,1437289,"Isn't it bad enough to plead with folks
from lower castes to get their votes?"
369,1437414,1439747,"Must we bend low in the hovels
of these people too?"
370,1439872,1442414,"Just stick to teaching.
Get going!"
371,1443747,1446622,"This Adult Literacy stuff must be axed!
That will fix things!"
372,1474956,1476581,Oh no!
373,1477789,1479747,Good grief!
374,1481039,1482289,O Mother!
375,1482414,1487706,"I'm devastated the jewellery you lovingly
gifted me has been stolen!"
376,1488622,1492581,"And you just stare at me so?
How is that right?"
377,1492706,1494831,"The hands who stole it
must go useless!"
378,1494956,1497747,His family will be ruined!
379,1497872,1501831,"No need for courts and police.
That woman on the wall will take care!"
380,1520331,1522497,"They dare to rob someone
from the ruling party!"
381,1522622,1525747,What the hell are you cops here for?
382,1525872,1527289,"You went out of town, sir."
383,1527414,1529664,"You could've informed us
before you left."
384,1529789,1531664,Did any strangers come in here?
385,1531789,1534164,"Let me know
if you suspect anyone."
386,1534289,1535872,I don't suspect anyone.
387,1535997,1539706,"That rat catcher wisecracked
asking if we'd make it to town."
388,1539831,1542581,"He jinxed us
and now all is lost!"
389,1543456,1545206,"Tell me who he is
and I'll question him."
390,1545331,1547706,"One of those chaps
from the Konamalai lake bank."
391,1547831,1548872,His name?
392,1548997,1550581,"What's his name?
-Rajakannu, sir."
393,1551539,1552539,Rajakannu!
394,1554289,1556081,"Constable!
-Yes, sir!"
395,1559456,1562331,"You promised you'd stay for six months
when you took the advance."
396,1564331,1565414,I'll get back in two days.
397,1566414,1569706,"Haven't even been here a month
and he wants to head home already!"
398,1569831,1572831,"Why come to work if you can't be away
from your family? Get back to work!"
399,1572956,1575122,"10,000 bricks need to be dispatched
tomorrow!"
400,1580331,1583164,"We'll get him. Be patient.
We're looking for him."
401,1583289,1584497,When?
402,1585456,1587956,"After he spends all the money
he made from the loot?"
403,1588081,1590622,"Then, you'll put him in prison
and that will appease me, eh?"
404,1591497,1592997,Good grief!
405,1593122,1595831,"Putting our faith in you
will do us no good!"
406,1595956,1597414,I'll talk to the Superintendent.
407,1597539,1599914,"I'll show you
the ruling party President's clout."
408,1610289,1611664,Wake him up and ask him.
409,1611789,1612997,Get up!
410,1613122,1614122,"Get up, I say!"
411,1614247,1618081,"Where's Rajakannu's house?
-The one under the neem tree."
412,1618206,1619331,"Shut up!
-Go straight."
413,1620706,1622372,"Check there, Constable!
-Yes, sir!"
414,1622497,1624831,"See if there's anyone there.
-Yes, sir!"
415,1624956,1626831,Check that hut over there too.
416,1628247,1630581,"We don't know anything, sir!
They've all gone for work!"
417,1630706,1632289,"One of you head there!
-Yes, sir!"
418,1639831,1641039,Get up.
419,1641164,1642247,Where's your husband?
420,1643581,1645372,"He went out of town
for work."
421,1645497,1646956,Why are you looking for him?
422,1647081,1648956,"Which town is he off to rob?
-""Rob""?"
423,1649081,1652081,"Only if I question you at the station
you'll open your mouth. Move!"
424,1653206,1654414,"At this hour, sir?"
425,1656372,1658539,"Whatever it is,
I'll come by in the morning."
426,1659331,1660331,Mom!
427,1660456,1662456,"Think you're Ms. World, eh?
Come along!"
428,1662581,1663664,"Come along, I say!"
429,1663789,1666372,"I don't know, sir!
-Keep going!"
430,1666497,1667956,"Alli!
-Come over here, Alli!"
431,1670039,1671247,Take care of Alli!
432,1676414,1678831,Where is your brother? Answer me!
433,1678956,1681247,"Aren't you his uncle?
-He did nothing!"
434,1681372,1682497,Get in!
435,1682622,1684706,"This woman is pregnant, sir."
436,1684831,1687372,"Really? Shall we have a baby shower
and deliver her child?"
437,1687497,1688622,Do your job!
438,1688747,1690289,"Load them up!
-Get in!"
439,1690414,1692497,"Get in, I say!"
440,1692622,1694372,"Drive!
-Shut up, woman!"
441,1702956,1704372,Mom...
442,1704787,1706827,Let's fight!
443,1706947,1709497,Let's fight till we get justice!
444,1709617,1711907,Let's fight!
445,1712037,1714577,Let's fight till we get justice!
446,1714697,1717157,Arrest them!
447,1717287,1720367,"Arrest the cop
who indulged in rowdyism!"
448,1720497,1722907,Let's fight!
449,1723037,1725747,Let's fight till we get justice!
450,1725867,1727997,Down with it!
451,1728117,1730747,Down with police brutality!
452,1730867,1732997,Let's fight!
453,1733117,1735787,Let's fight till we get justice!
454,1735907,1739117,"Down with it!
Down with police brutality!"
455,1739247,1740747,Who is at fault? Lawyer or cop?
456,1740867,1741867,"Lawyer, sir."
457,1741997,1744037,"If I do not strip you off your uniform
in court..."
458,1744157,1745787,"Strip off a cop's uniform, will you?"
459,1745907,1748697,"Send out a press release
saying the Inspector's suspended."
460,1749497,1752247,"The one you beat up yesterday,
is out protesting today."
461,1752367,1754497,"You call this 'thrashing'?
Useless fellows."
462,1754617,1756747,Let's fight till we get justice!
463,1756867,1758997,Arrest them!
464,1759117,1762367,"Arrest the cop
who indulged in rowdyism!"
465,1762497,1764367,Arrest them!
466,1764497,1766827,"Did you study law
to cause such lawlessness?"
467,1766947,1769747,"Quit making trouble
and disperse quietly."
468,1769867,1771657,Are cops born special or what?
469,1772697,1775077,"Register an FIR against the cops
who defied the law."
470,1775197,1776287,"Then, come for talks."
471,1776407,1779497,"I'll arrest the lawyer who misbehaved
at the station too. Cool with it?"
472,1779617,1783197,"You'll arrest a lawyer?
Lay a hand on one of us, if you dare!"
473,1783327,1784997,"Go ahead.
Try laying a hand!"
474,1785117,1786697,We go on an indefinite strike.
475,1786827,1790077,"Until the guilty cop is arrested,
no more hearings at the High Court!"
476,1790197,1792907,"Sit down, everyone!"
477,1793037,1796077,Down with police brutality!
478,1796197,1803447,Down with police brutality!
479,1803577,1808657,Down with police brutality!
480,1812997,1816197,"Sir...
Come back, sir!"
481,1823447,1826787,"As lawyers are protesting police brutality
at the Chennai High Court..."
482,1826907,1832617,"...the one lawyer conducting a case
has caused quite a stir among his peers!"
483,1843287,1846577,"How come you are here, Mr. Chandru?
You were the leading voice at the protest!"
484,1846697,1848197,And now you're here to try a case?
485,1848327,1851247,"The protest is to end a problem,
My Lord. Not to escalate."
486,1851367,1853787,"Else, his son will remain in jail
until the next hearing."
487,1853907,1854997,Good.
488,1857697,1859287,Glory to God Shiva!
489,1862217,1864717,"Not taking part in the protest,
Mr. Shankaran?"
490,1864837,1866257,"How could I, My Lord?"
491,1866387,1868837,"I can't protest even against
blood pressure and diabetes!"
492,1868967,1871007,"I watched the show for ten minutes
and came in."
493,1872007,1874547,"So, till the end,
you'll just watch the show?"
494,1874677,1875887,Glory to God Shiva!
495,1885797,1887137,Who let these people in?
496,1891387,1893047,"Sorry, My Lord."
497,1893177,1895177,"Thought the hearing was off,
due to the strike."
498,1895297,1897547,"What does a government lawyer
have to do with a strike?"
499,1897677,1898887,Irresponsible!
500,1899007,1901337,"Please proceed, Mr. Chandru."
501,1901467,1902637,My Lord!

742,2779637,2780637,Oh come on!
743,2785257,2786757,"Is this a jail cell
or a pig pen?"
744,2787757,2790257,"Him, her, and him."
745,2790387,2791837,Send everyone else out.
746,2791967,2793467,Send them all out!
747,2793587,2794757,"Get up, woman!
-Get up!"
748,2794887,2796387,"Go out!
-Get up and go!"
749,2796507,2798217,Get out.
750,2801757,2803637,"Have them wait out in the shed.
-Yes, sir."
751,2806047,2807887,"Get out, you!"
752,2808967,2809967,Get going!
753,2812007,2813007,Here. For both of you.
754,2814467,2816587,Here you go. Eat.
755,2816717,2818967,"You don't know where he is, huh?
-I don't, sir!"
756,2819087,2821547,"You don't know?
-I don't know!"
757,2821677,2824717,"You don't know, eh?
-Oh God!"
758,2824837,2826677,"You don't know where he is, huh?"
759,2826797,2828257,"We don't know, sir!"
760,2828387,2831797,"I've been yelling myself hoarse
for hours and you won't answer me?"
761,2838637,2839637,Answer me!
762,2839757,2840887,Save us!
763,2841007,2844837,"Who the hell are you calling?
Who can come in here to save you?"
764,2845837,2847887,"Who will save you?
-Please stop!"
765,2848007,2849007,"Go sit there, you!"
766,2849137,2851427,"Robbing towns
in the guise of snake catching, eh?"
767,2851547,2853717,"Do you steal alone or with your family?
Tell me!"
768,2857427,2859337,"Roll!
Roll the dice!"
769,2860427,2864217,(Rajakannu sings a song)
770,2867427,2868717,"That's the guy!
Nab him!"
771,2872717,2874427,"Hold it right there!
-What is it?"
772,2874547,2876637,"Don't let him get away!
-Brother!"
773,2876757,2878177,What's going on here?
774,2878297,2880717,"Bloody thief!
-What's wrong? Why are you hitting me?"
775,2880837,2883387,I didn't do anything wrong.
776,2883507,2885637,"Why must I steal?
Let go of me!"
777,2888717,2890587,Why are you hitting me?
778,2891967,2894257,"I didn't do anything wrong!
-Grab him!"
779,2894387,2897387,"I didn't do anything!
Let me go!"
780,2898507,2900257,"Let go of me, brother!"
781,2900387,2903137,"Restrain him!
-I never steal, brother!"
782,2903257,2905217,I didn't do anything wrong!
783,2907507,2908717,You thieving swine!
784,2915297,2916717,I didn't do anything!
785,2919217,2920927,I didn't do anything wrong!
786,2921047,2922427,"Greetings, sir."
787,2922547,2924547,"Hello, Sub-Inspector sir! Are you well?
-Yes."
788,2924677,2925837,Kathirvel called.
789,2925967,2927757,There's your thief right there!
790,2927887,2929137,So he's the guy?
791,2929257,2932507,"I just got back from out of town, sir!"
792,2932637,2934717,I did not steal anything!
793,2934837,2938087,"People work hard day and night
to make a fortune."
794,2938217,2942047,"You make off with it easy
and expect the cops to just watch the show?"
795,2942177,2944967,"You dare make us chase you around?
-I didn't steal, sir!"
796,2945087,2948717,"Trying to run away? How long did you think
you could keep this up?"
797,2948837,2950757,Get up!
798,2950887,2952257,"Ask around about me, sir!"
799,2952387,2954967,"Start the vehicle!
-Sir!"
800,2955087,2958177,"I worked on your fields many times, sir.
-Get lost!"
801,2958297,2961177,"Load him up!
-Tell them I do not steal, sir!"
802,2961297,2963837,"Get in!
-Tell them I do not steal, sir!"
803,2963967,2965797,Please believe me!
804,2974927,2975927,Go on!
805,2977177,2978587,Get up!
806,2978717,2980177,"I didn't steal, sir!"
807,2980297,2982007,"I'm not a thief!
-Dear!"
808,2982137,2983547,Drag him inside!
809,2983677,2986387,"Sengani!
-Come along!"
810,2986507,2989587,"I swear upon you
I didn't steal!"
811,2989717,2991547,"My dear!
-Why did you come here?"
812,2991677,2995087,"Let him go, sir!
-Do not hit her, sir."
813,2995217,2997007,"Ugh!
I'll burn you like the trash!"
814,2997137,2999257,"Stop!
Why risk another beating in there?"
815,2999387,3000467,"Listen to me.
Get going."
816,3000587,3003387,"If he did not steal, they'll let him go.
You shouldn't be here."
817,3003507,3005887,"Bring some food when you come
tomorrow. Now go!"
818,3006507,3007507,My dear!
819,3008797,3009887,My dear!
820,3010007,3012387,Tell them to let him go!
821,3012507,3014637,"Tell me where you hid the loot!
Answer me!"
822,3014757,3016337,My dear!
823,3023417,3025127,"Hoist him up!
-Please no!"
824,3025247,3027667,"Raise him!
-It hurts, sir!"
825,3027787,3030327,"Answer me!
-Let him go, sir."
826,3030457,3031827,"Tell them not to hurt him, sir."
827,3031957,3034327,"Tell me where the stolen loot is!
-Or he'll get beaten!"
828,3034457,3036207,"We didn't steal anything, sir."
829,3036327,3038167,He didn't do anything wrong.
830,3038287,3040077,"Tell the truth!
Do you confess?"
831,3040207,3042377,"Don't hit us, sir!"
832,3042497,3044707,Why get thrashed like this?
833,3044827,3048167,"Tell us where the stolen money
and jewels are! We'll release you."
834,3048287,3051707,"We swear on our families!
We didn't steal!"
835,3051827,3053877,Oh... is that so?
836,3053997,3056957,"Stop it!
Lower him down."
837,3057077,3058667,Lower him down.
838,3058787,3059957,Careful.
839,3061877,3063037,Quit yelling!
840,3063167,3064377,"Does it hurt, dear fellow?"
841,3067537,3068707,"Kiruba!
-Yes?"
842,3068827,3071877,"A herbal patch will heal this, right?
-We didn't steal, sir."
843,3078537,3079917,It burns!
844,3080037,3081707,"Let us go, sir!"
845,3081827,3084577,"Burns, doesn't it?
-Where did you stash the money and jewels?"
846,3084707,3086787,"Do you not see this,
O Goddess?"
847,3086917,3088037,Admit to the crime!
848,3089627,3092577,"How can I admit to a crime
I did not commit, sir?"
849,3093827,3096577,"I swear on my child
we didn't steal!"
850,3096707,3101167,"Let us go, sir!
We'll leave!"
851,3102037,3104457,Don't brand us as thieves!
852,3109827,3112327,"No matter how much we beat them,
they don't confess."
853,3113457,3116457,I don't know what else we can do.
854,3116577,3117827,Sir!
855,3118627,3122997,"We men are here, sir.
Please let the woman go home."
856,3133207,3134997,"Get up.
-Please don't, sir..."
857,3135127,3136127,"Get up, woman!"
858,3138077,3139537,Who among them is a man?
859,3139667,3141457,Him?
860,3141577,3142577,Him?
861,3142707,3144127,"Or him?
-Sir!"
862,3146457,3147457,Who among them is a man?
863,3150127,3151577,"Don't do this, sir!
-Back off!"
864,3151707,3153787,"How dare you all?
-Sir!"
865,3153917,3156377,"You dare order us
on who should stay and who should go?"
866,3156497,3158667,"Hands off!
Shut up!"
867,3158787,3160997,Now do you realize who the real man is?
868,3161127,3162827,"Now do you get it?
Where are you going?"
869,3162957,3164787,"Oh God!
-Let go!"
870,3165627,3166957,Get over here.
871,3167077,3170207,"You claim to be a man, right?
Show her your talents!"
872,3170327,3171497,I'll let her go.
873,3174747,3176127,Who among you is a man?
874,3176247,3178917,Show me who among you is a man!
875,3179037,3180287,"She's my sister, sir!"
876,3181667,3183207,"She's my sister, sir..."
877,3211747,3213377,Pachaiamma drank poison.
878,3214377,3216997,"It took four days at the hospital
to save her."
879,3218247,3220707,She has lost everything but her life!
880,3220827,3223667,"Just tell me what happened
at the police station."
881,3225287,3226787,"Other things, we'll talk later."
882,3227577,3228827,What happened the next day?
883,3240457,3241457,Send them to eat...
884,3241577,3243747,"Who let you in?
Get out!"
885,3243877,3244917,"Come here, Sentry!"
886,3248707,3251207,"Why are you screaming?
-What are you yelling for?"
887,3251327,3252667,Come along outside!
888,3252787,3254877,"Oh my God!
-Come out, I say!"
889,3254997,3257377,"I'll send him. You sit outside.
-Come. Quit yelling!"
890,3257497,3259077,"What have you done?
-Come outside!"
891,3259207,3261207,"What the hell were you doing,
Sentry?"
892,3280787,3281957,Just a minute.
893,3284077,3286207,"Been two years
since I gave the money you asked."
894,3286327,3287877,My juniors are getting promoted!
895,3287997,3289577,Please see to my promotion.
896,3293787,3299327,"No matter how many times we tell them,
the cops won't believe us, brother."
897,3300957,3303287,"Let's just do what they ask
and confess, brother."
898,3304207,3306327,"I can't bear this pain
anymore!"
899,3306457,3307457,"No, Irutappa..."
900,3309037,3311167,These wounds will heal in a few days.
901,3311917,3314127,"The stamp as thieves
will stay forever."
902,3315497,3317207,Don't break.
903,3318037,3319457,Just hold on a little longer.
904,3320287,3321667,Just hold on.
905,3321787,3323577,"Eat.
-Eat, brother."
906,3326037,3328537,"Open wider, my dear."
907,3335787,3338377,"Open wider, my dear."
908,3344667,3345667,Oh no!
909,3347917,3350167,"Just a little more, my dear."
910,3351787,3354077,Oh no!
911,3354207,3357417,"To brand him a thief,
they've tortured him so much..."
912,3357537,3359287,...he can't even eat one mouthful!
913,3359417,3361747,"I'll call you back.
-You'll all be ruined!"
914,3365377,3368327,"You dare wail at a police station?
-Don't, sir. Some mishap may happen."
915,3368457,3371037,"Here, this fellow puts on a show
and you're cursing me, eh?"
916,3371167,3372537,I'll slaughter you!
917,3372667,3374077,"Get in here!
-Let him go!"
918,3374207,3376207,"Don't forsake me, Sengani!
-Let him go, sir!"
919,3376327,3378167,"Do not give up on me!
-My dear!"
920,3378287,3380167,You're dead meat!
921,3380287,3382287,"Get lost, woman!"
922,3382417,3384627,"The two of you get up!
Get back in there!"
923,3384747,3387537,"Get in there!
-Keep moving!"
924,3387667,3389457,"He's running away, Kiruba! Get him!"
925,3389577,3390877,"Nab him!
-Stop!"
926,3390997,3392667,"You get in there!
-Where are you going?"
927,3394167,3397497,"Let go of my husband, sir.
Let him go, please!"
928,3398037,3399457,"Let go of me, sir!"
929,3399577,3402577,"Get in there! I'll break your limbs!
-Let me go, sir!"
930,3402707,3404787,"You dare run off under my watch?
-Let me go, sir!"
931,3404917,3406377,"Get in there!
-Let me go, sir!"
932,3406497,3408537,"Sir...
-Lock him up in there!"
933,3408667,3410077,Listen...
934,3414077,3415327,Things aren't going right.
935,3415457,3417537,Fetch someone influential in town soon.
936,3421577,3423627,Sir!
937,3424457,3428167,"You come wail here
after the evening lamp has been lit?"
938,3428287,3431627,"Don't you have all the stolen money
and jewels? Go see a good lawyer then!"
939,3431747,3434537,"What do we do
when even you accuse us so?"
940,3434667,3436997,"You are the President
of this village."
941,3437127,3442207,"Please tell the cops to not beat them.
That's all I ask of you. Please!"
942,3442327,3445747,"Did I become President
with your Irula tribe votes?"
943,3445877,3447577,The cheek of this vagrant!
944,3447707,3450707,Get out of my sight!
945,3478247,3480417,"What is it, sir?
What are you looking for now?"
946,3480537,3481627,Where is your husband?
947,3481747,3483457,I swear he hasn't come back!
948,3483577,3485827,"All three of them got away.
Inform us if they come here."
949,3485957,3490287,"Talk sense into him to surrender.
If not, nobody can save them!"
950,3490417,3492827,"What are you saying, sir?
When did this happen?"
951,3492957,3499207,"'Why create me in this cruel world, O God?'
-Please take care of Alli, sister."
952,3499327,3504577,"'Can you not hear these screams of pain?'
-Please take care of her until I get back!"
953,3505707,3511327,"'You, who is everywhere at once,
why are you nowhere near now?'"
954,3512127,3517247,"'Are all the prayers I offered to you
all these years not enough?'"
955,3519167,3525327,"'Is it fair if you trod upon
the already beaten down unfortunate?'"
956,3525457,3531497,"'Is it right if you put out
the million lights you lit yourself?'"
957,3531627,3536247,"'I stand here with tears
as my companion'"
958,3538247,3542207,'Is this my forever fate?'
959,3544537,3548627,'You know and see all'
960,3550997,3555377,"'Do you not have the heart
to save us?'"
961,3557667,3559377,"Hold it, woman!"
962,3559497,3561627,"You won't listen?
Stop!"
963,3561747,3563457,Who let you in here? Get out!
964,3563577,3564787,Did they really escape?
965,3564917,3568707,"If the Sub-Inspector sees you,
who knows what he'll do in his rage!"
966,3568827,3570747,"Get lost!
Drive her out!"
967,3572457,3574917,"Go!
-Get going!"
968,3575037,3578127,"'Why do you keep sending misfortunes
our way?'"
969,3578247,3582167,'Is my life to suffer without my love?'
970,3584747,3587537,'I did not ask for anything'
971,3587667,3591077,"'You gave it, then took it away'"
972,3591207,3594417,"'Without my beloved,
am I to suffer all alone?'"
973,3596707,3603077,"Down with police brutality!
-'You revealed a life I never dreamed'"
974,3603207,3608827,"'Without seeing its moon,
the sky stands defeated'"
975,3608957,3610957,"Think these flags and protests
will scare us?"
976,3611077,3612877,You run a party only to support thieves?
977,3612997,3614877,"All the missing people
are tribals!"
978,3614997,3621167,"If you don't take action, we'll complain
to every high ranking official there is!"
979,3621287,3623667,Will you politicize everything?
980,3623787,3626167,"Get a complaint from that woman, Bashyam.
-Yes, sir."
981,3626287,3629077,"File an FIR, conduct an inquiry
and submit the report."
982,3629207,3630207,"Alright, sir."
983,3634377,3636827,"Don't have a picture?
-No."
984,3636957,3639497,"How can we find a missing person
without his picture?"

take it to the District Court."

1173,4487421,4488971,This court can accept it if it wishes.
1174,4489091,4490921,No one can prevent it.

be taken as a precedent..."

1184,4522261,4523341,Excellent!
1185,4523471,4526221,"Normally, this would have been dismissed
in two minutes."
1186,4526341,4530261,"Quoting Rajan's case?
Good God, that was a wise move."
1187,4530381,4532631,The case is entirely in your favour now.
1188,4532761,4535011,"No, sir.
I feel I am handling this case wrongly."
1189,4535131,4539301,"No, you're not.
You're on the right path, I say!"
1190,4539421,4542801,"No, sir. I'm beginning to doubt
since you are so sure."
1191,4542921,4544591,I'm sure I'm missing something!
1192,4544721,4546011,"What is he...
-This way, sir!"
1193,4546131,4547131,"Laughing, are you?"
1194,4552301,4553761,"Am I late?
-Nothing like that."
1195,4568841,4570301,"Stop, Kiruba.
-Yes, sir."
1196,4572841,4574261,So he's the lawyer from Madras?
1197,4577721,4579671,"Heard an independent inquiry
is going on."
1198,4580671,4581721,So it's true then.
1199,4582801,4584761,Even the police couldn't do a damn thing.
1200,4584881,4586841,"Only you should find those culprits, sir."
1201,4586971,4590341,Definitely. I'll find them.
1202,4590471,4593011,I'll find the real culprits very soon.

1206,4651091,4652631,...a witness stand is brought in.
1207,4652761,4655721,"Not a VIP case even.

aren't you in the State's Medical Council?"
1216,4688551,4691131,"I'm an Ayurveda doctor, sir."
1217,4692591,4695511,"I have formally registered that, sir."
1218,4695631,4697881,Then why prescribe allopathic medicines?
1219,4698011,4701221,"You even have a huge sign at your clinic
that reads 'Mahesh, MBBS'."
1220,4704261,4707091,"Not just the witness, My Lords.
Even the doctor is fake!"
1221,4707221,4710471,"I object to this type of cross-examination,
My Lords."
1222,4711551,4715171,"The question is not whether he studied
Acupuncture or Ayurveda."
1223,4715301,4718761,"The case is whether persons who escaped
took treatment from his clinic or not."
1224,4718881,4721881,"Do you have any relevant questions
for this witness, Mr. Chandru?"
1225,4722761,4723761,"No, My Lord."
1226,4724671,4726881,Witness number two: Dhanasekar.
1227,4727011,4730421,"One of them had a tattoo of a flower.
Another one was short."
1228,4730551,4733261,Witness number three: Mr. Vinod.
1229,4733381,4735881,"As I was closing shop at night,
three men showed up."
1230,4736011,4737421,They gave me a prescription.
1231,4737551,4739131,And I gave them the medicine.
1232,4739261,4741261,"Do you have any questions,
Mr. Chandru?"
1233,4741381,4743801,"Mr. Chandru?
-Do you have any relevant questions?"
1234,4744671,4745671,"No, My Lord."
1235,4746421,4749131,"You may leave.
-Alright, sir."
1236,4749261,4752721,"Thought it would sizzle like firecrackers,
but it has fizzled out like flat soda!"
1237,4753971,4757091,"The opposition could not disprove
the witnesses, My Lords."
1238,4757221,4760261,"I seek instant dismissal of the case.
That's all."
1239,4766051,4769421,"File a forgery case against Dr. Mahesh,
Mr. Public Prosecutor."
1240,4769551,4771381,"He is disbarred from practice.
-Yes, sir!"
1241,4771511,4773511,"This case is dismiss...
-My Lords!"
1242,4773631,4776381,"I wish to examine Inspector Bashyam,
the inquiry officer."
1243,4778011,4779011,Why...
1244,4779131,4781341,"We can't shut out.
We can ask him to lead evidence."
1245,4781471,4782591,Alright.
1246,4782721,4784881,"Court is adjourned.
We'll continue after lunch."
1247,4785011,4786341,"Thank You, My Lords."
1248,4798971,4801471,"Just say what is in the report.
-Alright, sir."
1249,4801591,4804171,"If that lawyer tries to trip you up
with his questions..."
1250,4804301,4807721,"...just reply with a standard
'I don't know' or 'I don't remember'."
1251,4807841,4809091,"Understood?
-Yes."
1252,4809221,4811261,"Remember what we discussed?
-I got it."
1253,4811381,4814091,"""Three escaped convicts
from Athiyur got treatment..."""
1254,4814221,4815221,Glory to God Shiva...
1255,4820091,4821671,"Is this your report?
-Yes, sir."
1256,4821801,4823591,You know fully well what's in here?
1257,4823721,4825551,"Wake me up and ask
and I'd still be thorough!"
1258,4825671,4827221,Why? You memorized it so well?
1259,4828761,4832551,"How far away from the station
is the pharmacy the escapees went to?"
1260,4833631,4837131,"The store is called 'Om Medicals'.
The salesman's name is Mr. Vinod."
1261,4837881,4839591,Don't regurgitate what you memorized.
1262,4839721,4841221,Just answer the question.
1263,4841341,4844051,"Question: How far is the pharmacy
from the police station?"
1264,4844171,4845381,Well...
1265,4845511,4847381,I think it's a little bit away.
1266,4847511,4848631,Never mind that.
1267,4848761,4852471,"How far is the pharmacy from the clinic
of Dr. Mahesh, who treated the escapees?"
1268,4852591,4854421,Which side of the station is it?
1269,4854551,4856761,"I strongly object, My Lords."
1270,4857421,4862221,"The counsel is trying to confuse
and intimidate the witness."
1271,4862341,4865171,"The witness is no commoner.
He's an Inspector."
1272,4865301,4866971,The inquiry officer of this case.
1273,4867091,4868591,"Even I'm confused, My Lords."
1274,4868721,4871341,"Allow the counsel to proceed
in his own way, PP."
1275,4871471,4873671,"Please don't interrupt.
Sit down."
1276,4873801,4874801,Continue.
1277,4874921,4876091,Well...
1278,4876591,4877971,I don't know... can't remember.
1279,4878091,4879881,"Idiot!
He's saying both responses..."
1280,4880011,4882921,"You forgot an inquiry you conducted
a month ago?"
1281,4883051,4885011,I say you never conducted this inquiry.
1282,4885131,4886671,"This report isn't yours.
-I object!"
1283,4886801,4888171,"I strongly object, My Lords!"
1284,4888301,4890091,"I strongly object
to this suggestion."
1285,4890221,4892721,"Do you have any proof for your claim,
Counsel?"
1286,4892841,4895381,"I made a personal visit to that place,
My Lords."
1287,4896421,4901051,"Dr. Mahesh's clinic is two kilometres east
of the police station."
1288,4903341,4907301,"The pharmacy is one kilometre west
of the police station."
1289,4908131,4909921,"So, the three escapees..."
1290,4910051,4912551,"...ran two kilometres east
of the station..."
1291,4912671,4915381,"...showed their wounds
and got a prescription..."
1292,4915511,4918631,"...and ran three kilometres west
past the very same station..."
1293,4918761,4920631,"...and bought medicines
at the pharmacy."
1294,4920761,4923171,"That is what
Inspector Bashyam's inquiry report says!"
1295,4923881,4927341,"Would the escapees be doing catwalk
in front of the police station?"
1296,4927471,4929881,"Would he give such a report
if he investigated it himself?"
1297,4930011,4931051,No!
1298,4931631,4933091,I did investigate!
1299,4933221,4934591,I don't remember. I forgot...
1300,4934721,4935721,One or the other!
1301,4936881,4937921,My Lords.
1302,4938051,4942261,"A photocopy of the report Inspector Bashyam
submitted to the SP of Villupuram."
1303,4942381,4946011,"The FIR and chargesheet from Veerasamy,
the writer at Athiyur police station."
1304,4947471,4948511,My Lords.
1305,4948631,4952591,"With east and west, the counsel
has already confused the witness."
1306,4952721,4954221,"And now, these papers."
1307,4954341,4957051,"What does this case
have to do with these photocopies?"
1308,4957171,4959171,"Only your inquiry officer
can answer that!"
1309,4960221,4962421,Why does the handwriting on his report...
1310,4962551,4965671,"...and writer Veerasamy's handwriting
look the same?"
1311,4973091,4974261,"I'm sorry, My Lords."
1312,4974381,4976671,"In an attempt to help
my fellow officers..."
1313,4976801,4979721,...I signed the report given by them.
1314,4979841,4981471,Who the hell made you a cop?
1315,4981591,4983921,"Is this how one responds in court?
Nonsense!"
1316,4984801,4986671,"How do you respond to this, PP?"
1317,4986801,4989261,"What is there to say, My Lords?
I have nothing to say."
1318,4992841,4996261,"Good thing. At least you didn't respond
saying 'don't know', 'don't remember'!"
1319,4996381,4998551,"That will do.
-Glory to God Shiva..."
1320,4998671,5000511,"Do you admit to being
a false witness?"
1321,5001801,5004631,"Let's see if my case comes up now.
Glory to God Shiva..."
1322,5004761,5007881,"I can't refuse the police's demands, sir.
So..."
1323,5008011,5009801,It is an utter disgrace...
1324,5009921,5013341,"...that the evidence submitted
by the police, is fully fake."
1325,5013471,5016171,"The petition filed by Sengani
is prima facie valid."
1326,5017051,5020261,"Six months imprisonment
for the two who committed perjury."
1327,5021011,5025221,"We direct you to file a government report
within seven days, Mr. Public Prosecutor."
1328,5025341,5028381,"The department has to conduct an inquiry
on Inspector Bashyam."
1329,5035471,5037631,"When will they find my husband, sir?"
1330,5039091,5041631,"We will find him very soon.
Come along."
1331,5047721,5050301,"Good morning, sir."
1332,5050921,5052341,(High Court condemns)
1333,5053551,5056091,"It's become a routine
to be humiliated by that lawyer."
1334,5057131,5059421,"Must we stand ashamed in court
because of you?"
1335,5059551,5060591,"No, sir...
-Huh?"
1336,5062011,5065261,"You let a tribal woman
enter the High Court."
1337,5065381,5067221,Why the hell are you even a cop?
1338,5068841,5070721,Be bloody honest with me.
1339,5070841,5072721,Did you remand them in false cases?
1340,5072841,5073841,"Not at all, sir!"
1341,5073971,5075381,They escaped from prison.
1342,5075511,5078011,"As it was night,
there were no witnesses..."
1343,5078131,5080091,If I tell that to the judge...
1344,5080221,5082551,"...he'll ask
who the hell gave me a law degree!"
1345,5084841,5085841,"I'm sorry, sir."
1346,5085971,5089011,"If we are disgraced in court,
it's as if the government is disgraced!"
1347,5090881,5092011,Where is that case file?
1348,5098761,5100301,"Now on, I will lead the case myself!"

antagonizing the village and the cops?"
1371,5211441,5214601,"We give you a place to live and work
and it gets to your head?"

to burn down your huts?"

Come."

1410,5367521,5369401,Is someone called 'Sengani' there now?

1413,5372561,5373691,"Spinning me tales, eh?"
1414,5373811,5375351,The High Court is tearing me apart!
1415,5375481,5377981,"I'll release her immediately, sir."
1416,5378101,5380521,"Drop her back home
in the police jeep."
1417,5380651,5382311,"If not, you'll all be arrested!"

1422,5406941,5410151,"They took away Alli, sir."
1423,5410851,5412771,"Go to the police station.
I'll handle it."
1424,5419481,5420481,"Yes, My Lord."
1425,5425481,5426561,Ma'am...
1426,5426691,5427901,"Hold up, ma'am."
1427,5428021,5429691,Wait up!

We'll drop you."
1429,5432601,5433731,Ma'am?
1430,5435351,5437851,"They've told us to drop you home.
Please get in."
1431,5437981,5438981,"Hurry up, man!"
1432,5473941,5474941,"Come here, sir."
1433,5475901,5478651,"What's going on?
-The DGP ordered us to drop her home."
1434,5479351,5480401,"""The DGP""?"
1435,5482691,5484901,"The hearing is at 10:30?
-Yes, sir."
1436,5486401,5488851,"You informed the judges I'll be appearing?
-Yes, sir."

How are you, sir?"
1441,5514691,5516441,"I'm fine, My Lords.
Thank you."

Any further trouble from the police?"
1443,5522271,5524151,"No, sir.
-Good."
1444,5524271,5527811,"HCP: 711.
Respondent, Advocate General."
1445,5527941,5528941,My Lords.
1446,5529061,5532021,"I'd like to call the witness Dhanasekar,
the tea shop person."
1447,5533901,5535851,Tell the court what you witnessed.
1448,5535981,5538521,"Three men came to the shop
and drank tea."
1449,5538651,5539901,They were there for a while.
1450,5540021,5542151,"A lorry heading to Kerala pulled up
near the shop."
1451,5542271,5543481,They got on board and left.
1452,5543601,5548061,"My Lords, please permit
the prosecution to examine a key witness."
1453,5548191,5550351,"There is no prior request.
Who is this witness?"
1454,5550481,5552151,"Varadarajalu.
Rice mill owner."
1455,5552271,5553771,We just learned of this yesterday.
1456,5553901,5555521,"An important witness,
My Lords."
1457,5555651,5557231,"Any objection, Mr. Chandru?"
1458,5558691,5559691,"No, My Lords."
1459,5559811,5561351,"You may proceed, Advocate General."
1460,5561481,5564351,"Witness number five: Mr. Varadarajalu.
-Thank You, My Lords."
1461,5566771,5568981,"Tell the court
exactly what you know."
1462,5570481,5573101,"As I was leaving the mill that day,
I got a phone call."
1463,5576601,5578941,"Hello?
-This is Irutappa speaking, sir!"
1464,5579061,5580191,Where in the world are you?
1465,5580311,5583021,"We escaped from the police
and got out of town!"
1466,5583151,5585691,"We're fine, sir.
We'll be back once it's all clear."
1467,5585811,5587481,"Never mind all that!
Where are you?"
1468,5587601,5588981,Please let our families know.
1469,5589101,5590101,Hello?
1470,5590231,5593401,"It was Irutappan, my mill worker,
who had called."
1471,5593521,5595981,"How are you sure
it was Irutappan on the phone?"
1472,5596101,5598191,"He's been working for me
for over ten years."
1473,5598311,5600021,Won't I know his voice?
1474,5600151,5601521,"That's all, My Lords."
1475,5601651,5603651,This is just another political stunt.
1476,5603771,5606101,"An attempt to humiliate the government.
That's all!"
1477,5606231,5607771,Why didn't you tell the cops earlier?
1478,5607901,5609901,They only asked me about this yesterday.
1479,5610021,5612191,"You should've at least told
the families."
1480,5612311,5614561,"Another fake witness
from the prosecution..."
1481,5614691,5618351,"I did. I got all three families together
and told them!"
1482,5618481,5619941,You can ask Sengani about it.
1483,5627771,5630771,"Look how the AG flipped this case
with just one witness."
1484,5630901,5634941,"Sengani is well aware
of Rajakannu's whereabouts."
1485,5635061,5638311,"This case has been filed
with some ulterior motive."
1486,5638441,5641731,"She's a pitiful tribal woman.
She's innocent."
1487,5641851,5647441,"I think someone is misguiding her so as to
claim compensation from the government."
1488,5647561,5651151,"Many people from this community
are habitual offenders."
1489,5651271,5653561,"They hide away
in Andhra Pradesh or Kerala."
1490,5653691,5655441,Could you please submit these documents?
1491,5655561,5657271,The cops are actively looking for them.
1492,5657401,5659271,"So, the court can dismiss this case."
1493,5660311,5661771,"I need some more time, My Lords."
1494,5661901,5666561,"The AG has proved beyond any doubt
Rajakannu escaped police custody."
1495,5666691,5668021,Why do you need more time?
1496,5668151,5671351,"How can I cross-examine a witness
without preparing, My Lords?"
1497,5671481,5674351,"This is a genuine request.
The court should not deny it."
1498,5674481,5676771,"For what it's worth, let him have it.
-Yeah."
1499,5680021,5682351,"Okay. Time granted.
-Thank You, My Lords."
1500,5684351,5689851,Item number two: CMP 442 of 1995.
1501,5689981,5691231,Counsel for Petitioner.
1502,5692521,5697191,"Even if you had no proof or witnesses,
I believed you had the truth."
1503,5698561,5700231,It's my fault.
1504,5700351,5702651,I stood there looking like a fool!
1505,5704021,5705021,That's my fault too!
1506,5708771,5709981,Why did you hide the truth?
1507,5711901,5714401,"Don't you hear me?
Why didn't you tell the truth?"
1508,5715601,5717061,I told her not to tell you.
1509,5719561,5722901,"When they heard about the phone call,
no lawyer would take the case."
1510,5723021,5725271,"That's why, we thought it was best
to leave it out."
1511,5729191,5731021,I won't handle this case anymore.
1512,5731151,5732441,Find another lawyer.
1513,5736151,5737151,You may leave.
1514,5738351,5740691,"Please be patient
and listen to what I have to say."
1515,5740811,5743101,"There is no chance
Irutappan could've made that call."
1516,5743231,5745851,"I've taught adult literacy classes
for the rice mill workers."
1517,5745981,5748981,"It's not just Irutappan.
None of them know the alphabet or numbers!"
1518,5751151,5752151,"Irutappa!
-Ma'am?"
1519,5752271,5753851,How many sacks needed for this grain?
1520,5753981,5756101,"Around eight, teacher."
1521,5756231,5758151,"Which among these
is number eight?"
1522,5758271,5760351,"I don't know, teacher.
-You don't know?"
1523,5761311,5763271,"This is number eight.
Got it?"
1524,5764481,5767481,"Dialing an STD code on top of all that
is simply impossible!"
1525,5768651,5769651,Please...
1526,5770651,5773101,"Did the rice mill owner say
what was the date of the call?"
1527,5773231,5775191,"The day before the full moon day
of the month."
1528,5779691,5781771,The phone records you requested.
1529,5787401,5788561,Hello?
1530,5788691,5791061,"Do you know 'Varadarajalu rice mill'?
-Yes, I do."
1531,5791191,5793481,"Is that so? Where is your house?
-Villupuram."
1532,5793601,5795151,"Villupuram?
-Why do you ask?"
1533,5795271,5797351,"To deliver sweets for Diwali.
-My address is..."
1534,5797481,5799351,"I have the address.
I'll send it. Thank you."
1535,5803811,5807101,"Do you know 'Varadarajalu rice mill'?
-Yes. My sister's husband owns it."
1536,5807231,5810061,"Just checking if our load had arrived.
That's all. Thanks."
1537,5811351,5812351,241...
1538,5812481,5814021,"Yes, I know of it.
-I know it."
1539,5818691,5819851,"Hello?
Who is it?"
1540,5820731,5822731,I'm calling from 'Varadarajalu rice mill'.
1541,5823311,5824311,This number...
1542,5824441,5825521,This is an STD booth.
1543,5826771,5828021,"STD...
-This is Kerala."
1544,5829231,5830441,That's fine...
1545,5831481,5832811,"Where in Kerala?
-What?"
1546,5833691,5835191,(in Malayalam) Where in Kerala?
1547,5835311,5836311,Well...
1548,5836441,5838771,"Near Munnar, sir."
1549,5838901,5840101,Your name please?
1550,5840231,5841441,My name is Rajesh.
1551,5841561,5843271,"Rajesh?
-Yes."
1552,5843401,5846311,"What's this about?
-It's nothing. Thanks."
1553,5856271,5857271,Mythra.
1554,5859021,5862441,"I checked all the calls. One call
has come from a public booth in Kerala."
1555,5862561,5864521,"Only if we go there
we can find out for sure."
1556,5865731,5868101,Will Sengani be able to come that far?
1557,5868231,5869901,"I will go wherever this takes us, sir."

1565,5930901,5932981,"One of them is short.
They're Tamilians."
1566,5933731,5934731,Do you know of them?
1567,5934851,5936351,This state maybe Kerala.
1568,5936481,5939021,"But everyone who works here
are Tamilians."
1569,5941311,5943441,They made a call from this STD booth.
1570,5943561,5944851,A month ago.
1571,5944981,5946731,Please try and remember.

1587,6024231,6025561,Better now?
1588,6026601,6027601,Sir...
1589,6028271,6030151,You're doing us a huge help.
1590,6031231,6032231,But...
1591,6032981,6035351,I have no money to give you.
1592,6036851,6038691,To sell and raise money...
1593,6040101,6041101,...this is all I have.

1626,6195481,6197191,"You may start, Mr. Chandru."
1627,6197311,6199351,"I have a new witness to examine,
My Lords."
1628,6199481,6201351,I too learnt of him only yesterday.
1629,6202061,6203231,Permission granted.
1630,6208351,6209561,"Salutations, sir."
1631,6209691,6212691,"He is Mr. Rajesh.
He runs a phone booth in Munnar."

from his booth."
1633,6215691,6216941,"Great going, then!"
1634,6217901,6221901,"Many thanks to counsel for his efforts
in finding a witness for the prosecution!"
1635,6222521,6224271,"Hold on, sir.
Let the witness speak."
1636,6224401,6225731,By all means.
1637,6225851,6229061,"Estate workers come to my shop
to make phone calls."
1638,6229191,6231521,The phone booth is busy all the time.
1639,6231651,6234481,"In a space where one person should stand,
three were standing."
1640,6234601,6236021,That caught my attention.
1641,6236151,6237811,"Who are they?
What's this?"
1642,6237941,6240901,"The nerve of these people.
They've had it!"
1643,6241021,6242811,"Hello?
Hello?"
1644,6242941,6244941,"Hold up.
-Come on out. What's this?"
1645,6245061,6246231,Come along.
1646,6246351,6248771,"We're with the Tamil Nadu Police.
He's an officer."
1647,6248901,6251561,"You proceed, sir.
-So what? What's the problem?"
1648,6251691,6254901,"He's speaking on an important case
and you're making a scene here."
1649,6255021,6257271,"Come along.
We'll sort this."
1650,6257401,6258771,What nonsense...
1651,6260521,6261901,Can you identify them?
1652,6269981,6272101,"This witness does not seem credible,
My Lords!"
1653,6272231,6274901,"Weren't you just thanking me
for producing this witness?"
1654,6276151,6279101,"I wish to examine Sub-Inspector Guru,
My Lords."
1655,6280731,6282271,Permission granted.
1656,6282401,6284351,Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy.
1657,6292691,6294021,Were you in that phone booth?
1658,6300811,6302941,"Your silence will be taken
as affirmation."
1659,6303061,6304771,"Open your mouth and respond,
Mister!"
1660,6306021,6307401,Sir...
1661,6307521,6311851,"We got word that the three men who escaped
in a Kerala bound lorry, were in Munnar."
1662,6311981,6314981,"We went looking for them,
but could not find them."
1663,6315101,6318601,"The pressure was mounting
from complainant Kathirvel's side."
1664,6318731,6323521,"The Communist party also escalated this
by taking it to the Superintendent."
1665,6323651,6325851,The higher-ups couldn't stand the heat.
1666,6325981,6327601,"So, passing off as Irutappan..."
1667,6327731,6329151,...we made that phone call.
1668,6330601,6331941,Useless fellow.
1669,6332811,6335521,"The cops have repeatedly foul played
this case, My Lords."
1670,6335651,6337151,This case is nothing but a scandal!
1671,6337271,6338941,The local cops must no longer handle it!
1672,6339061,6340481,It must be handed over to the CBI!
1673,6340601,6343521,"Aren't the cops admitting the truth?
-One truth to hide many others!"
1674,6343651,6345271,"We want a CBI inquiry, My Lords!"
1675,6345401,6349061,"Do you not trust even a single officer
in the Tamil Nadu Police, Mr. Chandru?"
1676,6349191,6353101,"How many CBI investigations
have led to conviction of the guilty?"
1677,6353231,6357561,"We named Tamil Nadu cop Lethika Saran
to handle the Chidambaram Padmini case."
1678,6357691,6361651,"Didn't her thorough investigation
lead to the imprisonment of guilty cops?"
1679,6361771,6363561,"Similar to that, you suggest a name."
1680,6363691,6366151,"We'll appoint them
as the Investigating Officer."
1681,6379601,6381271,"He has suggested a cop
in the rank of IG."
1682,6381401,6382901,I don't think the state will object.
1683,6383021,6386561,"We pass order for Inspector General
Perumalsamy to investigate this case."
1684,6387481,6389651,"You may oversee the investigation,
Mr. Chandru."
1685,6389771,6391481,"The report must be submitted
in 30 days."
1686,6391601,6393811,"Please communicate this order
to IG Perumalsamy."
1687,6394521,6395851,"Thank you, My Lords."
1688,6396771,6397851,"Yes, My Lords."
1689,6400561,6402601,This case is escalating day by day.
1690,6402731,6406061,"The opposition party is giving interviews
about deteriorating law and order."
1691,6406191,6409401,"How will I answer the Chief Minister?
I can't make any sense of this."
1692,6411151,6412941,This case needs to be closed soon.
1693,6414231,6417231,"The CM has ticked my name
for a seat in the Parliament too."
1694,6418231,6419441,"But, if I lose this case..."
1695,6420941,6422981,"All my efforts so far
would have been in vain."
1696,6428441,6431101,"The Home Secretary is very concerned
about this case."
1697,6431231,6433151,"You know how law and order is.
-I do."
1698,6433271,6435021,The CM is very sensitive about it.
1699,6435151,6437651,"So, we can't do anything on a whim."
1700,6437771,6439771,The department must not be tainted.
1701,6440941,6443151,"This guy is a bothersome lawyer,
Perumalsamy."
1702,6443271,6444771,"Handle him carefully.
-Yes, sir."
1703,6445651,6446941,"Welcome, Chandru."
1704,6447901,6451151,"A cop who considers lawyers
to be the worst people on earth..."
1705,6451271,6455601,"...and a lawyer who considers the same
about cops are working a case together."
1706,6455731,6456941,"Strange, isn't it?"
1707,6457061,6459771,"I've been meaning to talk to you anyway.
Good you came."
1708,6459901,6462271,"You are against police torture, right?"
1709,6463271,6464401,We don't like it either.
1710,6465851,6468441,"Only if cops go to that extreme,
do thieves confess."
1711,6468561,6469851,What are we supposed to do?
1712,6469981,6473941,"To put an end to crime,
we cannot always abide by the law, Chandru."
1713,6474061,6475651,I'll give you a personal example.
1714,6476901,6478941,A school girl wrote to me.
1715,6479981,6482021,A local thug was molesting her every day.
1716,6482901,6486401,"If she told her family, she was afraid
they'd pull her out of school."
1717,6487061,6488851,No one else could know about it.
1718,6488981,6490901,"No complaint registered.
No FIR filed."
1719,6491561,6493351,What legal action do I take?
1720,6494651,6496191,"So, I went with my conscience."
1721,6496941,6500851,"I broke every one
of that ruffian's ten fingers."
1722,6500981,6503811,"As long as he lives,
he can't touch even his wife."
1723,6503941,6505941,"I know I was wrong
according to the law."
1724,6506811,6510561,"But, why must I wear this uniform
if I can't even keep a schoolgirl safe?"
1725,6512101,6514811,In order to uphold democracy...
1726,6514941,6518101,"...there will be times
one must be authoritarian."
1727,6519401,6520441,That's the truth.
1728,6525691,6527601,"Take a good look
at this case file."
1729,6527731,6531441,"You'll see how much nastier cops behaved,
when compared to that ruffian."
1730,6532521,6535691,"I look forward to see
how you uphold your democracy."
1731,6535811,6537901,And... I have a request.
1732,6538811,6541851,"You must meet a few people
before you start this investigation."
1733,6543311,6544651,Okay.
1734,6544771,6545811,Thank you.
1735,6548471,6553341,"Officials have come to listen to
how cops frame false cases against you."
1736,6553471,6555761,"Without any fear,
tell them everything."
1737,6555881,6557091,You can be seated.
1738,6557221,6558221,Please remain seated.
1739,6558341,6559341,Sir...
1740,6559471,6562881,"Against my father...
Against my husband..."
1741,6563011,6566971,"Now, against my son,
false cases are going on."
1742,6569261,6572381,"On my way back from a hunt at night,
I saw come cops."
1743,6572511,6574221,I greeted them with folded hands.
1744,6574341,6577171,"Claiming I no longer feared them
as I dared to greet them..."
1745,6577301,6581511,"...they put a theft case on me
and had me jailed for three years."
1746,6583631,6585171,I was walking down the road.
1747,6585301,6587131,Cops were standing ahead of me.
1748,6587261,6589131,"Wanting no trouble,
I kept to the other side."
1749,6589261,6592921,"Noticing that, they claimed I was trying
to get away from the police..."
1750,6593051,6595091,"...and charged me
with motorcycle theft."
1751,6595221,6596721,I can't even ride a bicycle!
1752,6598471,6603261,"They took me to the forest
and strung me up by the thumbs like this..."
1753,6603381,6606591,"...stuck a rod in the back of my neck
and beat me half to death!"
1754,6606721,6608471,I still didn't admit to any wrongdoing.
1755,6608591,6610971,"I'm afraid to even think about it!
-My husband..."
1756,6611091,6613341,"He even bore the pain, sir."
1757,6614051,6618511,"They brought me to the station
and did horrible things."
1758,6618631,6623761,"Unable to bear it,
my husband admitted to the crime."
1759,6631301,6632721,Does anyone else wish to speak?
1760,6639171,6642841,"When they couldn't find my father,
the cops took me in and beat me up."
1761,6643511,6646921,"Since then, even if an eraser goes missing
at school..."
1762,6647051,6649341,"...the first thing which is checked
is my bag."
1763,6649471,6652421,"Fearing that shame,
I don't even go to school."
1764,6675671,6678051,"Stop crying
and boldly tell us what happened."
1765,6684591,6685591,"Good morning, sir."
1766,6687881,6689721,"He is Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy.
-Sir."
1767,6693381,6694381,Stay here.
1768,6712551,6714971,"This earring was all that was recovered
from the loot."
1769,6715091,6718381,"What we spent serving coffee,
tea and food to investigating officers..."
1770,6718511,6721011,"...has only given back
a big, fat zero."
1771,6734841,6736591,"Your name?
-Kirubakaran."
1772,6736721,6738381,A Constable at the Athiyur station.
1773,6741591,6745051,"I don't know how I forgot to lock up
the cell that day."
1774,6745171,6747421,"I just resumed duty
following a suspension."
1775,6749341,6752801,"The three of us were handling security
at the local minister's meeting that day."
1776,6752921,6754671,We were on night patrol that day.
1777,6754801,6756971,"I went to buy dinner
for the Head Constable that day."
1778,6758671,6762471,"I covered the day shift.
I wasn't at the station that night."
1779,6762591,6764671,Was Rajakannu involved in the theft?
1780,6764801,6766011,"I don't know, sir."
1781,6766131,6770511,"But, Rajakannu was well aware there was
cash and jewellery in that closet..."
1782,6770631,6772261,...and that Kathirvel was out of town.
1783,6772381,6774011,Is it true Pachaiamma was harassed?
1784,6777421,6779011,"Well...
Sir..."
1785,6780591,6781721,"I have a conscience, sir."
1786,6781841,6785341,"Don't do it, sir. She's my aunt.
-Back off!"
1787,6785471,6787381,"Go on!
A man, he claims to be!"
1788,6787511,6789341,What's going on here?
1789,6797131,6799051,Take your clothes and wait outside!
1790,6799171,6800471,"What's going on there?
-Hey!"
1791,6801551,6804381,"This guy's out of control
and you just sit back and watch?"
1792,6804511,6805761,Do you have no conscience?
1793,6805881,6807801,Why are you supporting those thieves?
1794,6807921,6811591,"If there were to be a mishap,
we would all be in soup!"
1795,6811721,6813221,"Remember that!
-Okay then."
1796,6813341,6815011,"Go!
We'll deal with it when it comes!"
1797,6815131,6816261,You're not even human.
1798,6817971,6818971,Here.
1799,6821261,6822421,Go home.
1800,6824551,6827841,"If that had gone on,
she may have even committed suicide!"
1801,6828921,6830301,"You may go.
-Thank you, sir."
1802,6832591,6833921,Boldly tell the IG the truth.
1803,6835221,6837301,He'll never let down his fellow cops.
1804,6837421,6839131,I'm a cop too.
1805,6839261,6840881,"I've said the same line
to many others."
1806,6841721,6846051,"The victim of the theft filed a complaint
naming Rajakannu as their suspect."
1807,6846171,6848471,"No matter how much we beat him,
he didn't confess."
1808,6849551,6851171,How else could we get the truth out?
1809,6851301,6853921,"You look for the truth
by pulling down a woman's skirt?"
1810,6855051,6856131,"Natraj.
-Sir?"
1811,6856261,6858631,"Send a team to Kerala to investigate.
-Yes, sir."
1812,6858761,6861671,"Check every place there, where Irulas work.
-Yes, sir."
1813,6861801,6862921,Get out!
1814,6863051,6864131,"Salute, sir!
-Idiots..."
1815,6864261,6865261,At ease!
1816,6868171,6870301,"Inquiry statements
from the Athiyur station."
1817,6871381,6873551,"Here are the videos of it.
-Okay."
1818,6873671,6875471,"The IG told me to give it to you.
-Yeah."
1819,6876881,6879381,"What is your perception of this case,
Natraj?"
1820,6879511,6881221,Could all three of them have escaped?
1821,6881341,6882761,"It's a tiny station, sir."
1822,6883551,6886551,"Night time too.
Only four cops were present."
1823,6886671,6888091,Two of whom were asleep.
1824,6888921,6891551,"So, chances are high
the three of them did escape."
1825,6891671,6893671,"Out of fear,
the SI made a lot of mistakes."
1826,6893801,6898171,"Besides, it's quite common for many in
their caste to be convicted in theft cases."
1827,6900051,6902511,"Is any caste devoid of thieves,
Natraj?"
1828,6902631,6906221,"In yours, in mine...
there are thieves in every caste!"
1829,6907221,6909801,"First, stop branding people
based on their caste."
1830,6909921,6911721,"Sorry.
I didn't mean it that way."
1831,6911841,6914511,"It's okay. Tell the IG
I'll talk to him after going over this."
1832,6914631,6915761,"Okay, sir."
1833,6919171,6923091,"We scoured Kerala
and every place where the Irulas work."
1834,6923221,6924301,"Not a clue.
-Sir!"
1835,6925801,6928131,I don't think they're roaming free.
1836,6928261,6931471,"Didn't they escape in a lorry?
Could they have been caught at a checkpost?"
1837,6931591,6934841,"No, sir. We notified
every police station in the district."
1838,6934971,6937471,"If they were arrested,
we'd be told of it."
1839,6937591,6940721,"Would you be told of an arrest
made on false charges too?"
1840,6940841,6943421,"I'm sorry, sir.
Not every cop is a bad person."
1841,6945341,6947341,Not every cop is a good person either.
1842,6947471,6948551,Natraj...
1843,6948671,6951091,"We look into the wrongdoings
of criminals."
1844,6951221,6953421,"He looks into the wrongdoings
of cops."
1845,6953551,6954671,Listen up.
1846,6954801,6957421,"Collect FIRs from that week
from every station."
1847,6957551,6961261,"Track down every jail, sub-jail
and special jail in the district."
1848,6961381,6962381,"Yes, sir."
1849,6968381,6970381,"Come on in!
Stand in line!"
1850,6986171,6987171,Hello?
1851,6987301,6991761,"The kids are ready to be picked up
from coaching. Send the jeep."
1852,6991881,6993301,"You'll never change, will you?"
1853,7011011,7012511,"Got a flashlight?
Bring it over."
1854,7014761,7015761,Thank you.
1855,7026091,7028051,"Dhanashekar...
-Sir?"
1856,7028171,7030511,"Any more police stations
in the surrounding area?"
1857,7030631,7033921,"Yes, there is. But this is the last one
inside the Tamil Nadu border."
1858,7035171,7038131,"The next station falls under
Pondicherry limits."
1859,7045761,7047091,"Good morning, sir."
1860,7062341,7064171,Many files are missing serial numbers.
1861,7065221,7067341,"Some of them don't even carry photos.
-Sir..."
1862,7067471,7069171,"Lot of rat trouble
at the station, sir."
1863,7069301,7072761,"We dispose the bitten pages ourselves,
as higher-ups would blast us otherwise."
1864,7072881,7074551,"Rats will nibble it, bit by bit."
1865,7074671,7076921,"Why not give it to donkeys?
They'll finish it clean."
1866,7077051,7078131,"Sure, sir."
1867,7094341,7095341,Anything serious?
1868,7097091,7098091,I'm not sure...
1869,7108671,7109671,He's here.
1870,7110471,7111721,This is Subramani. The VAO.
1871,7111841,7113881,"He reached the scene first.
-Yes, sir."
1872,7114011,7115421,"Have a seat.
-Yes, sir."
1873,7116011,7117471,"All set?
-Yes, sir."
1874,7118511,7122511,"As soon as I heard,
I sent my men over early, to secure it."
1875,7123421,7125921,"There was nothing here
during patrol at 10 PM."
1876,7126051,7128671,"Someone did a hit and run accident
after that."
1877,7128801,7130221,Even a lorry had gone past.
1878,7132551,7135221,"Only below the knees
comes under the Tamil Nadu border."
1879,7135341,7137721,"Three-fourths of the body
is in your station's limits."
1880,7137841,7139591,You need to take charge of the body.
1881,7139721,7141721,"Couldn't he have died
four feet further away?"
1882,7141841,7146511,"Consider our plight guarding a dead body
all night with a torch!"
1883,7146631,7148221,"Yet, you are mocking us."
1884,7148341,7151341,"Your job ends with laying limits
to the corpse."
1885,7152721,7156221,"Who's the victim? Was it an accident
or murder? If murder, what's the motive?"
1886,7156341,7158671,"Before this wraps up,
we'd be knocked out."
1887,7158801,7162131,"If no one claims the body,
we'll have to turn undertaker too!"
1888,7162261,7163511,Load that in.
1889,7164511,7167881,"Till the end,
we didn't know who the victim was, sir."
1890,7170131,7172221,"Are the forensics here?
-They're on the way."
1891,7176631,7177801,Remain seated.
1892,7188341,7190801,"The forensic officer from Pondicherry.
-Hello, sir."
1893,7190921,7192091,Have a seat.
1894,7192761,7195051,"Fingerprints, footprints,
body findings."
1895,7195171,7198801,"All the fingerprints and impressions
found at the scene are in here."
1896,7198921,7201631,"Are there any pictures from the scene?
-Yes, sir."
1897,7201761,7204551,"All photos from every hit and run case
of that month."
1898,7313591,7316011,"Why on earth are you printing my hand
on this, dearie?"
1899,7316591,7319261,"This will be the first brick
in the house we build, dear."
1900,7334671,7335971,My dear!
1901,7341471,7342471,My dear!
1902,7344011,7345011,My dear!
1903,7353301,7355011,You people!
1904,7355721,7358631,"When will you tell me
the news of my husband's death?"
1905,7358761,7361761,"Tell us that too!
It'll do you a lot of good!"
1906,7364761,7366551,Why torment us so?
1907,7366671,7368511,Is there no one to question this?
1908,7369261,7372221,"You left before you could even see
your son's face!"
1909,7384381,7387671,"Playing the cop game with me too, eh?
-Nothing like that, sir."
1910,7388631,7391091,"No one from the government
will represent you anymore!"
1911,7392591,7394721,"We hid the truth out of fear, sir."
1912,7395881,7398051,Only you can save us in this case.
1913,7398171,7399881,"Whatever it takes,
we are ready!"
1914,7404631,7407131,"First, tell me what the hell happened!"
1915,7407261,7408381,"Sir, I..."
1916,7415761,7419671,"The pressure was mounting
from the higher-ups to close this case."
1917,7419801,7420801,Confess!
1918,7420921,7423841,"You'll be beaten to death!
-I don't know anything, sir!"
1919,7423971,7427221,"Confess! Won't you bloody confess?
I'll beat you to death!"
1920,7427341,7428381,Confess!
1921,7428511,7430591,"Won't you confess?
Where are the jewels?"
1922,7431341,7433971,"Shut up!
Make a sound and I'll kill you!"
1923,7434091,7437091,Tell me where the jewels are!
1924,7437221,7439341,"I didn't steal anything, sir!"
1925,7439471,7440471,Will you confess?
1926,7440591,7443091,"No matter how much we beat him,
Rajakannu didn't break."
1927,7443881,7444971,Our bad time...
1928,7446471,7447801,Everything went wrong.
1929,7449341,7452341,"Hey!
Get up!"
1930,7463761,7465261,"Rajakannu is dead, sir."
1931,7465381,7466921,No one at the station knows.
1932,7467051,7468341,I'm an utter mess!
1933,7468471,7470051,Don't panic!
1934,7470171,7471721,"Don't panic.
Do what I say."
1935,7472551,7473761,"Alright, sir."
1936,7477261,7479631,Sekar! Sentry Sekar!
1937,7479761,7480921,Always dozing off!
1938,7481671,7483301,Get us two meals!
1939,7498721,7499971,Hurry up.
1940,7534381,7536171,"Get up, you two!
-Sir?"
1941,7536301,7538801,"Why didn't you lock the cell?
Those three escaped!"
1942,7538921,7541471,"What are you saying?
-Are you deaf? I said they escaped!"
1943,7541591,7544341,"Don't just stand there! Find them!
-Yes, sir!"
1944,7544471,7547881,Three suspects escaped from their cell.
1945,7548011,7549921,"Let me know if you hear anything, sir."
1946,7550051,7552471,"You followed my instructions, right?
-Yes, sir."
1947,7557051,7558841,"Clean this up.
-Yes, sir."
1948,7560171,7562921,"Why the hell weren't you watching them?
Where's your uniform?"
1949,7563051,7564051,"Sir, I..."
1950,7564171,7566051,Be ready to face the SP's fire!
1951,7566171,7569011,"If those three aren't found by dawn,
you're all finished!"
1952,7584381,7586761,"Whenever you're asked to testify,
you come. Got it?"
1953,7586881,7590792,"Anyone asks, one of them had a tattoo
of a flower on his hand. Stick to it!"
1954,7609721,7610721,Sir...
1955,7612011,7613881,"What are we going to do
with the other two?"
1956,7619131,7620171,I'll tell you.
1957,7653091,7655131,"Lift it down, Kiruba.
-Yes, sir."
1958,7655261,7656341,Hold tight.
1959,7662301,7663881,Get back in!
1960,7674131,7675341,No corpse.
1961,7676261,7677511,No eyewitnesses.
1962,7679721,7681631,"This can't be proved
as a lock-up death."
1963,7683091,7686971,"Under pressure from the SP, you beat them.
They escaped."
1964,7687091,7688631,"Stick to that story.
-Yes, sir."
1965,7688761,7691511,"Until the case is over,
lie low."
1966,7691631,7692671,Understood.
1967,7695471,7698921,"The accident happened when they tried
to escape from the Athiyur police station."
1968,7699051,7700801,Rajakannu died in the accident.
1969,7700921,7703341,"This is the report
from the Pondicherry police."
1970,7703471,7705301,The cops are looking for the other two.
1971,7705421,7709301,"It is my humble request
this petition to be dismissed, My Lords."
1972,7709421,7712591,"An innocent man was beaten to death
in custody and thrown out on the street!"
1973,7713591,7716551,"We don't know if the other two
are still alive. How can this be over?"
1974,7716671,7717921,How do you call him innocent?
1975,7718051,7720011,There's proof he pawned the stolen jewels.
1976,7720131,7722881,"Irutappan and Mosakutty went underground
with the stolen money!"
1977,7723011,7725131,"The only innocent party here
are the police!"
1978,7727511,7730221,"I'd like to question
the 'innocent' cop Veerasamy."
1979,7730971,7732011,My Lords...
1980,7732131,7735761,"Following that, I humbly request
the Honourable Court to decide."
1981,7736971,7737971,"Okay.
Proceed."
1982,7745671,7749011,"Do you maintain a general diary
to record daily activities at the station?"
1983,7749131,7750131,"We do, sir."
1984,7751671,7755761,"You've written that they escaped
at 9:50 PM."
1985,7755881,7756921,Is that correct?
1986,7758051,7759091,That is correct.
1987,7759221,7763671,"When did you inform SI Gurumurthy,
the station in-charge, about it?"
1988,7763801,7766841,"Those of us on duty
tried looking for them for a while."
1989,7766971,7768131,We did not find them.
1990,7768261,7771051,Then... at about 10:10...
1991,7771171,7774421,"I called the Sub-Inspector
and told him what happened."
1992,7775221,7776341,My Lords...
1993,7776471,7779671,"I'd like to bring to the notice
of this court something very important."
1994,7779801,7783671,"There is an entry in the general diary
of the escape at 9:50 PM."
1995,7784671,7788551,"Here's the outgoing call record list
of the station on the day in question."
1996,7788671,7793551,"According to it, a call was made
to Guru's residence at 9:10 PM."
1997,7794631,7797301,"More importantly...
After 9:50 PM..."
1998,7797421,7800301,"...no further calls were made to Guru
from the station."
1999,7802341,7804221,That's why Chandru is a brilliant lawyer.
2000,7804341,7806381,He already had these records.
2001,7806511,7808131,He always waits for the right time.
2002,7810261,7812051,"Of the three,
Rajakannu is dead."
2003,7813841,7816301,"We don't know
what became of Mosakutty and Irutappan."
2004,7816421,7818221,"No one cares about it, either."
2005,7818971,7821131,"Those two are the only witnesses
to the truth."
2006,7821801,7824131,Beyond words of support to justice...
2007,7824261,7827261,"...the court's silence towards injustice
is more dangerous."
2008,7827381,7829341,"We need more time to investigate,
My Lords."
2009,7829471,7832091,"Having indulged him so far,
we can give him another ten days."
2010,7832221,7833761,Should be fine.
2011,7835721,7838051,"Next hearing in ten days.
-Thank You, My Lords."
2012,7845921,7848551,Have Chandru meet me in my chamber.
2013,7848671,7851881,"Even if a judge calls, he won't go
to meet them in their chamber, sir."
2014,7863901,7865861,"Tea for Sir, comrade.
-No, thanks."
2015,7872491,7875491,"What are you going to achieve
in ten days, Chandru?"
2016,7875611,7877781,I'll get that woman a fair settlement.
2017,7878701,7881201,"That's the only good thing
you can do for your client."
2018,7882571,7884861,"I didn't take up this case
to achieve anything."
2019,7884991,7887991,"I'm fighting for justice
for an innocent tribal woman."
2020,7888111,7889861,"For Sengani today,
for another tomorrow!"
2021,7889991,7892071,"If denied justice here,
I'll take to the streets!"
2022,7892201,7894451,"The law is a weapon for my fight.
That's all!"
2023,7896201,7899071,"I won't spare anyone
who's responsible for Rajakannu's death."
2024,7902451,7904401,"Best of Luck.
-Back at you!"
2025,7910151,7912111,Chandru won't listen to reason.
2026,7912241,7914321,Try brokering a compromise.
2027,7914451,7918281,"Or else, it's trouble for you!
-Sure, sir. Let me try."
2028,7923071,7925321,"A seat in the Parliament
is all the AG cares about."
2029,7925451,7927821,"The DGP doesn't want the department
to be tarnished."
2030,7928781,7933321,"The Sub-Inspector has money, caste base
and local support backing him up."
2031,7934861,7936451,They will go to any extreme.
2032,7938071,7940741,"Criminals have caste, money, and power
backing them up."
2033,7942321,7943611,But the victims?
2034,7944701,7945901,We are all they have.
2035,7947321,7949111,Let's go to any extreme too.
2036,7960401,7963951,Do not trample!
2037,7964071,7967491,Do not trample upon tribals!
2038,7967611,7971611,We will not rest!
2039,7971741,7973741,"We will not rest
until we get justice!"
2040,7976201,7977241,Here.
2041,7979451,7981991,"We couldn't stop the injustice
done to Rajakannu."
2042,7983361,7987321,"To make sure another does not suffer
his fate, we must fight."
2043,8010651,8012651,(We demand justice)
2044,8029071,8030281,We demand justice!
2045,8030401,8033241,For Rajakannu's death...
2046,8033361,8036321,...we demand justice!
2047,8036451,8039151,For the tribals...
2048,8039281,8041951,...we demand justice!
2049,8042071,8044701,Do not do it!
2050,8044821,8047451,Do not foist false cases!
2051,8047571,8050321,Do not do it!
2052,8050451,8053201,Do not foist false cases!
2053,8053321,8056071,Down with brutality!
2054,8056201,8058901,Arrest them!
2055,8059031,8060031,Arrest the cops!
2056,8063491,8065951,"This case is dragging our department
through the mud."
2057,8066071,8067071,"Yes, sir."
2058,8068951,8072071,"We can negotiate an out-of-court settlement
for the affected family."
2059,8072201,8074111,"Handle it.
-I'm sorry."
2060,8074241,8075611,I can't broker a compromise.
2061,8075741,8078201,"Put this aside for the department's sake,
Perumalsamy."
2062,8078321,8080651,"I can put aside anything
for the department."
2063,8080781,8083491,"But I will never put aside my conscience.
I'm sorry."
2064,8087781,8089951,"The dead man is not going
to come back to life."
2065,8090071,8092651,"There is no evidence to prove
he died in custody."
2066,8093901,8095781,Those cops will be acquitted.
2067,8097281,8099951,"In the end, only the department
will be humiliated."
2068,8100071,8103321,"Why do you deny that poor family
the money they will receive?"
2069,8103451,8105241,"If you can't do it,
I'll do it myself."
2070,8107991,8108991,"Okay, sir."
2071,8111531,8113651,The forensic report from Kathirvel's house.
2072,8117201,8119531,"Bring me the details of the pawn broker.
-Yes, sir."
2073,8121401,8125401,"(in Hindi) I've already told them
everything, sir. But, they..."
2074,8127571,8129031,Why are you hitting me?
2075,8129151,8130361,Speak in Tamil.
2076,8130491,8131821,"Speak up!
-Alright."
2077,8133321,8135031,They were guys I know from my area...
2078,8143531,8144741,"""Sir..."""
2079,8144861,8148531,"""We got word the three men who escaped
in a Kerala bound lorry, were in Munnar."""
2080,8148651,8151491,"""We went looking for them,
but could not find them."""
2081,8151611,8153491,"""In order to cool things down..."""
2082,8153611,8155111,"""...passing off as Irutappan..."""
2083,8155241,8157321,"""...we called the rice mill owner
ourselves."""
2084,8160451,8162321,"""In order to cool things down..."""
2085,8162451,8166401,"""...passing off as Irutappan, we called
the rice mill owner ourselves."""
2086,8166531,8168531,"He's been working for me
for over ten years."
2087,8168651,8170031,Won't I know his voice?
2088,8171781,8174451,"In a space where one person should stand,
three were standing."
2089,8174571,8175781,That caught my attention.
2090,8181781,8182951,"Hello?
-Natraj?"
2091,8183071,8184241,"Go ahead, sir."
2092,8184361,8187451,"I need a record of SI Guru's
service history."
2093,8187571,8189201,"Okay, sir.
-Immediately."
2094,8192361,8194781,"According to Mythra,
Iruttapan cannot read numbers."
2095,8195781,8198781,"But the rice mill owner was sure
it was Irutappan who called him."
2096,8199821,8202991,"Rajesh of Munnar said there were
three people in the booth."
2097,8203111,8204951,But writer Veerasamy...
2098,8205071,8207951,"...spoke to Rajesh
outside of the phone booth."
2099,8208071,8210151,If we can connect the dots...
2100,8210281,8212031,"...it was Irutappan
on the phone."
2101,8212991,8216281,"But it was the police
who forced him to make that call."
2102,8217781,8221151,"Guru served in Udumalaipet for three years?
-Yes, sir."
2103,8221281,8226031,"That phone booth is eighty kilometres
from the Udumalaipet police station."
2104,8226151,8228701,"Guru still has good rapport
with his old station."
2105,8230991,8232861,We were right in searching in the jails.
2106,8233781,8237071,We were just looking in the wrong ones.
2107,8261451,8263401,"That doctor over there, sir.
-Thank you."
2108,8266201,8267701,"I just need a minute, doctor."
2109,8268951,8270401,"Please wait.
-Sure."
2110,8277571,8278571,Bring them over.
2111,8278701,8281781,"You stated the cause of death
was a broken rib piercing the heart."
2112,8281901,8284611,"That could be caused by the cops
kicking and stomping, right?"
2113,8284741,8286031,Quite possible.
2114,8286151,8287741,But I can't say for certain.
2115,8287861,8290951,"Being run over by a vehicle
could've also caused it. I'm not sure."
2116,8292031,8293451,"No, doctor, I..."
2117,8293571,8296741,"Can you confirm Rajakannu's time of death?
-That's difficult."
2118,8296861,8298361,We cannot be that precise.
2119,8299701,8300701,Doctor...
2120,8301401,8303111,"Doctor, please."
2121,8303241,8306901,"I need at least one evidence
to prove Rajakannu died in police custody."
2122,8307031,8309781,"You may have missed something.
Think hard."
2123,8314651,8315951,You won't win this case.
2124,8317111,8319951,"There's proof Rajakannu was killed
in a road accident."
2125,8323531,8324701,If you're fine with it...
2126,8325651,8328651,"...I'll talk to those cops
and get you the money you need."
2127,8329451,8331451,You'll need it for your children's future.
2128,8332571,8333651,You need to decide.
2129,8339651,8341111,To the baby on the way...
2130,8342281,8344281,...there is no father I can show.
2131,8347201,8348991,But I'll have lots of money!
2132,8351321,8353281,That is what will feed my children.
2133,8356861,8359901,"If they ask me how I got
the money for food..."
2134,8361821,8364651,"""It was given by the same people
who beat your father to death."""
2135,8364781,8366151,"""That's how we survive!"""
2136,8366281,8367571,"Should I tell them that, sir?"
2137,8373031,8375861,"There's no one that cares
when we get killed."
2138,8377611,8380281,"But we won't live on alms
from the killers!"
2139,8382571,8384071,I don't care if I lose this case.
2140,8385241,8387451,"I'll tell my children
we went down fighting."
2141,8390451,8391901,If you can...
2142,8392031,8393991,...punish those murderous cops.
2143,8399491,8400651,Please think it over...
2144,8414951,8417991,"Everyone stand in line!
Come on!"
2145,8420151,8422031,"Hands down!
Stand in line!"
2146,8424031,8426151,"Move aside.
Step up front!"
2147,8429031,8430031,Mosakutty?
2148,8432611,8433611,Teacher ma'am!
2149,8436321,8438071,"Where's Irutappan?
Isn't he with you?"
2150,8438201,8440651,"Irutappan is in this prison too, sir!"
2151,8450151,8451701,"Is my brother well,
teacher ma'am?"
2152,8461031,8462701,My work is all about details.
2153,8464611,8466281,Do not question my experience!
2154,8469821,8473031,"In my capacity, I cannot conclude
Rajakannu's death is a murder."
2155,8478321,8479321,"Sorry, Mr. Chandru."
2156,8480701,8481701,It's okay.
2157,8484071,8485781,"We just need to get through
tomorrow."
2158,8486821,8489031,"The judge panel changes
after that."
2159,8489151,8492151,"If Mosakutty and Irutappan don't make it
to court tomorrow..."
2160,8492281,8493861,...the hearing can be postponed.
2161,8503531,8504951,"Neither of them were there, sir."
2162,8505071,8507701,"Your department men
have moved their families somewhere."
2163,8507821,8508821,What do we do now?
2164,8513401,8517361,"They're at the full security camp house,
sir. The IG is there too."
2165,8517491,8519991,"I hear Sengani alone
is staying at the lawyer's house."
2166,8542821,8547241,"With no fear, tell us what happened
at the Athiyur police station, Mosakutty."
2167,8550701,8551741,Sir...
2168,8553111,8557821,"The Sub-Inspector tortured us
to confess to the theft."
2169,8559321,8560951,"Don't know, eh?
-I don't know, sir!"
2170,8561071,8564401,"Don't know, do you?
-I don't know, sir!"
2171,8565281,8566611,"Tell them not to hurt him, sir!"
2172,8566741,8569111,"As long as you don't confess,
he'll get beaten!"
2173,8569241,8571401,"Where have you hidden
the stolen jewels and cash?"
2174,8571531,8572531,Get over here!
2175,8575701,8579741,"They kept beating Uncle Rajakannu
to make him confess!"
2176,8579861,8581241,"I did not steal, sir."
2177,8582611,8584531,Hold it firm!
2178,8584651,8587451,"I did not steal, sir!"
2179,8587571,8589651,"I didn't, sir!"
2180,8589781,8592821,"How many times do I tell you to confess?
Confess to the theft!"
2181,8592951,8594951,"Won't you bloody confess?
-I did not steal!"
2182,8595071,8597741,"Won't you confess? Should I beg to you?
-I did not steal!"
2183,8597861,8598951,I'll beat you to death!
2184,8599071,8601701,"Confess!
Where are the jewels?"
2185,8601821,8603111,Hold it tightly!
2186,8605151,8607991,"My brother did nothing wrong, sir!
-Will you confess?"
2187,8609241,8610241,Confess!
2188,8614781,8616111,Bloody confess to the theft!
2189,8617991,8620451,"Confess!
How long I've been asking?"
2190,8620571,8622781,"Confess to the theft!
-Let my brother go, sir!"
2191,8623781,8625701,"Confess!
Won't you bloody confess?"
2192,8625821,8626951,Must I beg to you?
2193,8627071,8629071,"Stop hitting him, sir!
-Let go of my leg!"
2194,8630571,8631571,You dare touch my leg?
2195,8632281,8633281,You dare touch me?
2196,8636861,8639151,"Here you go, sir.
-What do I tell the SP?"
2197,8639281,8641241,"He won't confess
no matter how much I beat him!"
2198,8655321,8656651,I...
2199,8656781,8658201,"...didn't steal, sir."
2200,8658321,8659611,"I didn't steal, sir."
2201,8660491,8661491,I didn't steal...
2202,8661611,8662611,Bloody die!
2203,8685071,8687861,"He stomped my uncle
right in his chest."
2204,8689151,8692321,He coughed up hard and fainted.
2205,8694111,8695571,Irutappan...
2206,8695701,8698031,...wasn't stirring at all...
2207,8698151,8699151,Get up!
2208,8700071,8701281,Irutappa...
2209,8710531,8712951,Uncle...
2210,8713071,8715201,I tried waking them up...
2211,8715321,8717531,"Neither of them
opened their eyes."
2212,8720531,8722201,What happened next?
2213,8722321,8724821,They said my uncle had escaped.
2214,8724951,8726821,They beat us up.
2215,8726951,8730901,"After that, they threw us in jail
in some other town."
2216,8731031,8733741,"When did you come to learn
of Rajakannu's death?"
2217,8733861,8736611,"When the teacher told us
day before yesterday."
2218,8738321,8739741,"That's all, My Lords."
2219,8739861,8744651,"Neither Irutappan nor Mosakutty
witnessed Rajakannu's death."
2220,8744781,8746861,Pretending to be unconscious...
2221,8746991,8749861,"...when the police were in panic,
Rajakannu escaped."
2222,8749991,8751781,"On the way,
he died in an accident."
2223,8751901,8754821,"So, this cannot be portrayed
as a case of lock-up death!"
2224,8756071,8758031,The witness is not done with his testimony.
2225,8766071,8767071,Sir...
2226,8768361,8769361,Sir!
2227,8769491,8770491,What is it?
2228,8770611,8772901,"Both of them haven't woken up
for a long time!"
2229,8774241,8776241,Please come quickly and take a look!
2230,8777321,8778531,Sir...
2231,8778651,8780611,"What the hell is it?
-They're not waking up."
2232,8780741,8783321,"They are both not waking up...
-Shut up!"
2233,8783451,8784861,"Sit down, I say!"
2234,8786821,8788031,"Wake up, you!"
2235,8793651,8795111,Hey!
2236,8795241,8796741,Wake up!
2237,8800861,8802741,Wake the hell up!
2238,8803781,8805151,"Wake up, I say!"
2239,8808951,8811451,"If you make a single sound,
you are done for!"
2240,8811571,8813071,"Kiruba!
-Yes, Constable sir?"
2241,8815111,8816741,"Get inside!
-Sir!"
2242,8819781,8822071,"What happened, sir?
-Get some chilli powder."
2243,8833361,8835781,It burns!
2244,8835901,8837741,"It burns!
-Lift him up!"
2245,8840071,8842401,"It burns!
-Get up! Keep quiet!"
2246,8842531,8844361,"Pour some!
-Here."
2247,8844491,8846151,Pour more!
2248,8846281,8847531,Beat him...
2249,8847651,8849241,"Take him to that room.
-Come along!"
2250,8849361,8850901,Go!
2251,8851031,8853951,"It burns like hell!
-Get down..."
2252,8854071,8856361,"Sit down!
Shut up or I'll kill you!"
2253,8856491,8858741,Make a sound and you're done for!
2254,8858861,8860781,"Stay quiet!
-It burns..."
2255,8861861,8864401,"I couldn't even open my eyes, sir."
2256,8865901,8868901,"They locked up Mosakutty and me
in a room."
2257,8870491,8872361,My brother was unconscious.
2258,8874031,8878071,"The autopsy report says the cause of death
as a broken rib that pierced the heart."
2259,8879611,8882701,"Because SI Guru repeatedly stomped
on Rajakannu's chest..."
2260,8883901,8886111,"...the latter died, when inside the jail."
2261,8886241,8889111,"It's a clear cut case of murder
in lock-up by the police."
2262,8890281,8893361,"My Lords, I'd like to call the doctor
to throw some clarity on this."
2263,8900281,8901651,Doctor...
2264,8901781,8906361,"If I'm not wrong, the accident
could've broken Rajakannu's rib, right?"
2265,8906491,8907571,It might have.
2266,8907701,8908781,My Lords...
2267,8908901,8912611,"The counsel is tactful in changing
a Habeas Corpus petition..."
2268,8912741,8913901,...into a murder trial.
2269,8914031,8916701,But on examining Rajakannu's body...
2270,8916821,8921611,"...I found some kind of powder
on his face and facial hair."
2271,8921741,8924491,"Suspecting it was poison,
I sent it to the lab."
2272,8925281,8926991,It tested negative.
2273,8927111,8928531,It was not poison.
2274,8928651,8929741,It was chilli powder.
2275,8949151,8951571,"Hey... wake up.
Rajakannu!"
2276,8952321,8953321,Kiruba!
2277,8964781,8968651,"How could someone travel this far
with chilli powder in their eyes?"
2278,8968781,8971071,"Had he been alive
when the powder was sprinkled..."
2279,8971201,8973201,...there would've been a severe reaction.
2280,8973321,8975491,"There was no reaction
in the corpse's eyes."
2281,8975611,8976701,My Lords...
2282,8976821,8980151,"If there are doubts in Rajakannu's death,
the High Court need not hear it."
2283,8980281,8981951,Transfer the trial to a Criminal Court!
2284,8982071,8985321,"This is no police station border
to shrug off our responsibility!"
2285,8985451,8987401,"This is the High Court.
Don't you forget it!"
2286,8987531,8989821,"Like the narrative
that tribals are innocent..."
2287,8989951,8991611,...we brand the police as suspects!
2288,8991741,8992951,This is not fair!
2289,8993071,8994901,"So you don't know
who the criminals are?"
2290,8996111,8997201,You're about to find out.
2291,8997321,9000651,"My Lords, I wish to examine
Investigating Officer Perumalsamy."
2292,9010281,9011321,Sir!
2293,9011451,9014151,"This case began
with the theft at Kathirvel's house."
2294,9014821,9017611,"Two sets of fingerprints
were found at the crime scene."
2295,9018651,9021241,"One belonged to Rajakannu,
who went there to catch a snake."
2296,9021361,9023531,"The other belonged to Ravi.
The actual thief."
2297,9026701,9028991,"Guys I know from my area, sir."
2298,9029111,9030281,They visited me.
2299,9030401,9032451,They offered me a great deal.
2300,9033281,9035241,I bought it for a low price.
2301,9035361,9037281,"Lured by money,
I went along with it."
2302,9045241,9048611,"It's the house of a ruling party member.
I need to show recovery."
2303,9048741,9050321,Return some of the stolen jewels.
2304,9050451,9052071,"Right, Constable sir?
-Indeed."
2305,9052201,9053651,"What say?
-Alright, sir."
2306,9053781,9057201,"Despite knowing who stole it,
the cops took a bribe from the guilty..."
2307,9057321,9060031,"...and made a scapegoat
out of the innocent Irulas."
2308,9060151,9061151,My Lords!
2309,9061281,9065281,"Does the counsel have evidence to establish
Rajakannu was killed in custody?"
2310,9065401,9066951,"That's my question!
-We do, sir!"
2311,9070571,9073321,"Tyre marks of a van were found
next to the body of Rajakannu."
2312,9073451,9075241,"Along with shoe prints
of two people."
2313,9078241,9080781,"It matched with the van
used by the Athiyur police."
2314,9082321,9084241,"The shoe prints
at the crime scene..."
2315,9084361,9087111,"...matched those of SI Guru
and Constable Kiruba."
2316,9093151,9094571,I am ashamed to say...
2317,9094701,9097611,"...Rajakannu was murdered in lock-up
by the police."
2318,9097741,9100651,"The cops themselves dumped the body
at the Pondicherry border."
2319,9100781,9104031,"My investigation report contains
the entire details of the incident."
2320,9111281,9113151,"Thank you, Mr. Perumalsamy.
-Yes, sir!"
2321,9114991,9118701,"Since the AG has the right to pre-audience,
he's permitted to rest the case first."
2322,9119701,9120861,My Lords...
2323,9120991,9125401,"From the start, the inquiry has been driven
by the narrative that 'police are guilty'."
2324,9125531,9130111,"The court can give any punishment
for harassing the victim illegally."
2325,9130741,9134781,"I deeply regret the pain and agony
the victims have gone through."
2326,9134901,9137651,But all are equal in the eyes of the law!
2327,9137781,9140741,"So, I request a free and fair trial
in a Criminal Court."
2328,9140861,9144361,"Just because the police assaulted, it
shouldn't be converted as a case of murder."
2329,9144491,9148361,"The law permits them
to demand a fair trial."
2330,9149281,9151071,"That's my humble request,
My Lords."
2331,9152151,9153151,My Lords...
2332,9154151,9156361,"Irulas don't have a place
even in a village map."
2333,9157491,9160861,"Skilled bowmen, who go back centuries,
they live as bonded labourers now."
2334,9161651,9163611,They are treated like address-less orphans.
2335,9163741,9166901,"Is this a High Court or a history class,
Mr. Chandru? I don't understand!"
2336,9167031,9169281,It's not knowing history that led to...
2337,9169401,9173241,"...such cruelty towards the native tribes
of the Tamil land!"
2338,9176241,9179741,"Sengani and her family work
as bonded labourers for a paltry amount."
2339,9179861,9181821,They tried to dupe her with lakhs.
2340,9183401,9185071,"She said, ""I don't want your money."""
2341,9185611,9187401,"""I want justice for my husband's death."""
2342,9187531,9190531,"This Court must not betray
Sengani's faith in the law of the land."
2343,9191741,9193491,To those of you unaware of history...
2344,9193951,9197031,"Sengani, who demands justice
for her husband who was beaten to death..."
2345,9197151,9199571,"...is today's incarnation
of the epic heroine Kannagi!"
2346,9199701,9202951,"The petition filed by this destitute woman
is the modern 'Silapathikaaram'!"
2347,9203071,9207281,"Like then, are we going to deny justice now
or not, is what the court should decide."
2348,9208321,9209491,My Lords!
2349,9209611,9211901,The guilty must be severely punished.
2350,9213151,9215901,The affected must be duly compensated.
2351,9216031,9218741,"As a gesture of upholding
the rights of Irulas..."
2352,9218861,9221781,"...who have been denied
even a pinch of land for generations..."
2353,9223071,9226281,"I ask a land grant be provided
to Sengani inside the town."
2354,9227401,9230151,"This is no ordinary case
of custodial murder."
2355,9231281,9234611,"It is a tribal woman's rousing question
as to why no one stands up for them..."
2356,9234741,9237361,"...when arrogant authorities
brutalize them!"
2357,9238651,9240281,"So asks, her Habeas Corpus petition."
2358,9241571,9243571,"What the court will give
is no mere judgment."
2359,9244991,9246031,It is hope.
2360,9248031,9249451,"That's all, My Lords."
2361,9263361,9265991,"The verdict in this case
will be given shortly."
2362,9268321,9269901,"So much for the seat
in Parliament."
2363,9272241,9274151,I don't know what the verdict will be.
2364,9275821,9279861,"But I have total satisfaction that I acted
according to the law and conscience."
2365,9282991,9283991,Thank you.
2366,9302901,9304491,Without any justification...
2367,9304611,9309611,"...Rajakannu and his family
were illegally arrested and tortured."
2368,9309741,9312651,We order the trial for Rajakannu's murder.
2369,9312781,9319611,"We name SI Gurumurthy, HC Veerasamy
and Constable Kirubakaran as the accused."
2370,9319741,9322571,They have to be arrested immediately.
2371,9322701,9326031,"We order a compensation of 3 lakhs
to Sengani and 2 lakhs each..."
2372,9326151,9330321,"...to Mosakutty, Irutappan and Pachaiamma,
to be paid by the State."
2373,9330451,9334321,"That apart, Sengani must be given
half-a-ground land grant..."
2374,9334451,9338281,...in a central place in the village.
2375,9338401,9341321,"If the police and the judiciary
work together..."
2376,9341451,9343901,"...the rights of the people
will be upheld."
2377,9344031,9346361,"This case is a clear illustration
of that."
2378,9346491,9350781,"We record our appreciation
for the team headed by the IG..."
2379,9350901,9356321,"...in redeeming the image
lost by the police before this court."
2380,9356451,9360781,"For taking all effort to obtain justice
for a tribal woman..."
2381,9360901,9364658,"...this court heartily commends
advocate Chandru."
