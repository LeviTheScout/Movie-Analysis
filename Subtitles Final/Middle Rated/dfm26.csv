you would corrupt him? [chuckles]"

1242,5401833,5402833,You lied to me.
1243,5405541,5406750,You told me he was dead.
1244,5413166,5414166,Why?
1245,5419500,5421208,For the sake of our marriage.
1246,5422541,5424791,"By allowing me to believe
that I'd killed him?"
1247,5436250,5441500,"I know that I betrayed you, Lawrence."
1248,5443708,5445291,I live with it every day.
1249,5446833,5451083,"And I have spent
the last four years of my life..."
1250,5453666,5455416,trying to be a better wife for you.
1251,5457458,5460083,"But I remember, Larry,
I remember everything."
1252,5461166,5465500,"And the truth is, you and I were broken
long before Anthony came into my life."
1253,5465583,5467166,"- [softly] Jennifer.
- Don't touch me."
1254,5467250,5469833,"- Jenny, listen...
- [sternly] No, you listen to me now!"
1255,5472375,5477125,"[softly] The only reason I am still here
is because of our daughter."
1256,5478291,5482125,"From this day forward,
I am your wife in name only."
1257,5482208,5485291,"And if you so much as attempt
to treat me otherwise,"
1258,5486041,5488958,"I will take our daughter,
and I will leave."
1259,5489041,5490083,[grabs roughly]
1260,5491791,5496041,"Now if you think the courts will side with
an adulteress, then you're delusional."
1261,5497875,5500791,"And if you try to leave,
if you try to take my child,"
1262,5500875,5501875,"I will destroy you,"
1263,5502625,5504833,"and you'll never see her again.

1268,5522791,5525000,"We're gonna go on an adventure, okay?"
1269,5532833,5537000,"Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Anthony O'Hare.
He's in room 268."
1270,5537083,5540166,"[woman] Mr. O'Hare
is no longer staying with us here."
1271,5545333,5546625,When did he leave?
1272,5546708,5547708,Yesterday.
1273,5551416,5552416,Thank you.
1274,5554000,5556291,[woman] Ma'am? Stop for a second.
1275,5556375,5558875,"- Anthony?
- [woman] Excuse me. Ma'am?"
1276,5560041,5561541,What's going on in here?
1277,5562000,5563833,[woman] I've been trying to explain.
1278,5564500,5566125,"- [man] Mary Ellen?
- [Jenny] Anthony?"
1279,5567458,5571333,"I'm... I'm looking for Anthony O'Hare.
I need to know where he is, please."
1280,5571416,5574875,"I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,
but Anthony handed in his notice."
1281,5574958,5576708,He resigned this morning.
1282,5576791,5580041,"- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- I'm sorry to say he did not."
1283,5603833,5606250,"Perhaps you could see to it
that he gets these."
1284,5606333,5609583,"If you hear from Anthony again,
please tell him I was looking for him."
1285,5630708,5633750,"So then you...
you went back to your husband?"
1286,5635750,5637750,I just couldn't risk losing her.
1287,5639083,5641208,"And I did eventually leave him,"
1288,5642166,5645333,"when I knew for certain
that the law would support my decision."
1289,5646250,5647458,What about Mr. O'Hare?
1290,5648500,5652541,"Did you try getting in touch
with him once... once you'd left?"
1291,5652625,5657375,"I would scour the papers
every day looking for his name."
1292,5658791,5661666,"Nothing. And eventually,
I stopped buying the paper."
1293,5661750,5664291,"It felt to me
as though he didn't want to be found."
1294,5664958,5666125,But what about now?
1295,5668708,5672666,"You know, he doesn't know that
you tried to go after him. He has no idea."
1296,5672750,5676083,Probably for the best. We had our chance.
1297,5676166,5679875,"Yes, but what...
what if you could have another chance?"
1298,5679958,5682291,"Our heart can only take so much,"
1299,5682375,5686958,"and I fear, at my age,
I've reached my limit."
1300,5691541,5694541,"[Ellie] The past can be intoxicating.
It can draw you in,"
1301,5694625,5697666,"create the illusion
that things were better, you were happier,"
1302,5697750,5700250,or experiences were richer back then.
1303,5700916,5702541,"It can also debilitate you,"
1304,5702625,5706791,"leaving you stuck in your memories
of pain, heartbreak, and disappointment,"
1305,5706875,5710458,"holding you back from even attempting
another shot at happiness."
1306,5710541,5714291,"They say if we don't learn from past
mistakes, we're bound to repeat them."
1307,5714916,5717791,"But can we also learn
to let go of the past,"
1308,5717875,5720500,"learn to forge ahead,
keeping the knowledge close"
1309,5720583,5724500,"but not letting it overtake
our ability to try again, to feel again?"
1310,5724583,5726166,"Ellie, it's fantastic."
1311,5726708,5728250,Okay. Um...
1312,5730458,5732625,"- [woman] Really good work here.

1313,5733125,5735583,"Well, that's great.

1314,5737500,5739541,[uplifting instrumental music playing]
1315,5741000,5742208,I'll be back later.
1316,5751791,5755208,[phone ringing]
1317,5760541,5763541,"- Hello?
- [Ellie] Hi, it's, uh... it's Ellie."
1318,5763625,5764875,"Um, how's it going?"
1319,5765625,5767833,"Yeah, I'm fine. You?"
1320,5768541,5769833,"[Ellie] Uh, pretty good."
1321,5772875,5776166,"No, that's... that's...
that's not actually true."
1322,5777750,5780125,"I don't know why I left
without saying goodbye,"
1323,5780208,5783128,"and I don't know why I didn't reply
to any of your messages. That's, uh..."
1324,5783166,5787625,"That's a really shitty thing, and, I mean,
if you wanted to message me again,"
1325,5787708,5789583,you have my word you'll get a reply.
1326,5790583,5796041,"But I get there might be a ton of reasons
why you don't wanna speak to me"
1327,5796125,5798458,or write to me or hang out with me.
1328,5798541,5803500,"And, in truth, I'm kinda worried you might
think I'm a pretty heinous individual"
1329,5803583,5804916,"if you get to know me, but..."
1330,5807583,5808583,"But at this point,"
1331,5810625,5813875,"I don't think being afraid to try
is a good enough reason for anything."
1332,5815625,5816625,And I...
1333,5817458,5819791,"I think you're fucking tip-top, Rory."
1334,5820458,5822333,And I'd...
1335,5823541,5825208,I'd really love to see you again.
1336,5827791,5830083,"I hope you don't mind

1337,5834125,5835333,[sighs]
1338,5835875,5837458,"Look, where... where are you?"
1339,5838125,5839791,I'm... I'm... I'm outside.
1340,5841166,5842166,Sorry?
1341,5842666,5844750,I'm outside your flat. [chuckles]
1342,5847833,5848958,Oh my God. That's so creepy.
1343,5849041,5853083,"Yeah, well, I was aiming for industrious
but I... um, I take your point. [chuckles]"
1344,5854208,5856083,"Okay, okay, wait there. Just keep talking."
1345,5856166,5858375,I'm gonna come down. Keep talking.

1347,5866416,5867458,[Ellie] I'm so sor...
1348,5885875,5888291,I found them. Both of them.
1349,5889958,5891125,I went to see them. [laughs]
1350,5891208,5892416,"- You're kidding.
- No."
1351,5893500,5894916,Shit. What did they say?
1352,5895000,5898000,"- She tried everything.
- He still doesn't know she went after him?"
1353,5898083,5900017,"- No, he's got no idea.
- So you have to tell him."
1354,5900041,5903250,"I know! I want to,
but they don't wanna see each other."
1355,5903333,5906500,"If that was true, then why keep
the PO box open the whole time?"
1356,5907125,5908833,That doesn't make any sense.
1357,5910041,5911500,That is a really good point.
1358,5914291,5915750,She really came after me?
