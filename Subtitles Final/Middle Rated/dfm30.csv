- [Man] We have an appointment."
12,148318,150987,"Yes. Come in.
Welcome to St. Cloud's."
13,151071,153531,"We're going right upstairs
to see Dr Larch."
14,153657,156117,"[Narrating] I came as a physician
to the abandoned children..."
15,156242,159496,and unhappily pregnant women.
16,159579,162123,I had hoped to become a hero.
17,162248,165752,"But in St. Cloud's,
there was no such position."
18,165835,168588,"In the Ionely, sordid world
of lost children,"

22,176471,179766,"Well, in a way,
there was one."

24,181977,184604,"[Narrating] His name
was Homer Wells."
25,184688,189109,"I named him after
the Greek writer."
26,189192,191236,"You know, Homer, of course?"
27,193154,197784,"And I made his name Wells
because I could tell he was..."
28,197867,200537,very deep.
29,200620,202622,"[Narrating] In truth,
Nurse Angela named him."
30,202706,205959,"Her father drilled wells, and she once
owned a cat named Homer."
31,206042,208294,"Bye-bye, Homer."
32,208378,210880,[Knocking]
33,213049,216094,"- [Larch] Good night,
you Princes of Maine,
- Can we see the doctor?"
34,216177,219097,You Kings of New England.
35,219180,221433,"- [Boys] Good night.
- [Woman] Doctor?"
36,221516,224811,"Doctor?
There's something wrong with him."
37,224894,228148,"- He never makes a sound.
- [Narrating] He didn't cry."
38,228231,231776,"Orphan babies learn
there's no point in it."
39,231860,235196,"Do you think we could have a look
at someone a little different?"
40,239242,241619,[Cooing]
41,241703,245665,"Thus was Homer Wells returned.
He was too happy a baby."
42,245749,248293,"- [Woman] Bye, Homer.
- [Grunts]"
43,248376,253131,"[Narrating] The second
family to adopt him had a gift
for getting sounds out of Homer."
44,253214,255634,"- [Homer Screaming]
- They beat him."
45,255717,258094,He couldn't stop crying.
46,258178,261681,"Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh."
47,261765,264351,[Screaming Continues]
48,264434,267103,It's okay now.

any more"

each rule I make or break..."
51,273943,277530,"that my first priority
is an orphan's future."
52,277614,281034,"Twice adopted,
twice returned."
53,281117,283495,It didn't bode well.
54,287457,292045,"And yet it was always clear to
me that he was a special boy."
55,292128,295382,"- Near the angle of the rib. And...
- [Children Chattering]"
56,295465,297884,"- [Narrating] It was with
Homer's future in mind...
- Homer?"
57,297968,302305,"- That I began his tutorials.
- If you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,"
58,302389,304474,I expect you to be of use.
59,304557,307352,"[Narrating] I admit
that our lessons were, in part,"
60,307435,311982,"- the simple expression
of a father's love.
- Homer."
61,312065,314859,"But in failing to
withhold love..."
62,314943,317904,"and making the orphanage
his home,"
63,317988,323410,"had I created a true
and everlasting orphan?"
64,323493,326705,"- No!
- Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay."
65,326788,330583,"[Narrating] And so my
excellent pupil learned to look
after abandoned children..."
66,330667,334671,"- and to deliver unwanted babies.
- Relax!"
67,334754,338341,"Long ago, I had decided
that sometimes..."
68,338425,341344,"it was the women
who needed to be delivered."
69,348351,351354,I chose my own path.
70,351438,354899,"No one would ever choose
for Homer Wells."
71,368038,371291,"[Woman]
I saw the splendour of the moonlight"
72,371374,376296,On Honolulu Bay

in the moonlight"
74,379632,384429,On Honolulu Bay
75,384512,389142,"And all the beaches
are full of peaches"

82,420090,422676,Dr Larch?
83,422759,425095,We have two new patients.
84,425178,427639,"- One to deliver.
- Coming."
85,429557,432686,"- First pregnancy?
- [Homer] Yes, for both."
86,432769,436106,"I presume you'd prefer
handling the delivery?"
87,436189,438858,"All I said was,
I don't wanna perform abortions."
88,438942,441486,"I have no argument
with you performing them."
89,441569,444864,"You know how to help these women.
How can you not feel obligated..."
90,444948,447534,"to help them when they can't
get help anywhere else?"
91,447617,452038,"One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
how to do it. You just showed me."
92,452122,456501,"What else could I have shown
you, Homer? The only thing
I can teach you is what I know."
93,456584,460380,"In any life,
you have to be of use."
94,460463,462716,Of use? Of use.
95,462799,464634,[Crying]
96,464718,469556,"That was good, Carla. That was perfect.
Everything's gonna be fine."
97,469639,473518,"- I don't wanna see it.
- You don't have to see it, dear.
Don't worry."
98,473601,477355,"I don't even wanna know
what sex it is, so don't tell me!"
99,477439,481234,"- We won't tell you.
You're gonna be okay.
- Your baby's gonna be okay too."
100,481318,484404,"- I don't wanna know!
- That's a big boy."
101,484487,487365,"[Groans]
Let me see him."
102,487449,489534,I wanna see him.
103,491161,493872,"- Would you mind joining me
in the nursery?
- Okay."
104,497917,500879,"Wilbur, the adopting couple
is waiting in your office."
105,500962,505008,"Life is waiting.
Let 'em wait."
106,505091,507093,Where's the name sheet?
107,507177,509512,"Uh, nobody's named
this one yet."
108,509596,515435,"Oh, it's my turn. Henceforth,
you shall be Little Dorrit."
109,515518,517854,"- [Screaming]
- Oh."
110,517937,520273,"No, you don't like that,
do you?"
111,520357,522859,"He's a boy, that's why."
112,522942,525195,Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
113,525278,528114,"- I don't think so.
- You do it."
114,528198,530575,Okay.
115,530659,534120,"Henceforth,
you shall be Little Wilbur."
116,537332,539292,"I'm not crazy about
the ""Little."""
117,539376,542545,"Okay, just Wilbur then."
118,542629,547550,"We haven't had a Wilbur in a year or so,
have we? We used to have dozens."
119,547717,550136,"He sniffs that ether.
I've seen him do it."
120,550220,552973,"It's because he's too tired
to sleep. He has to."
121,553056,555141,"He smells like he could
put you to sleep."
122,555225,557978,"He's a doctor, Buster.
Doctors smell like ether."
123,558061,560730,"- You're a doctor, Homer.
You don't smell like ether.
- I'm not a doctor."
124,560814,564109,"I haven't been to medical school.
I haven't even been to high school."
125,564192,568822,"- But you've studied
with the old man for years.
- I'm not a doctor."
126,569906,571825,"I'm sorry, Homer."
127,571908,573952,"I saw the splendour
of the moonlight"

133,590552,593596,"I haven't either,
but you will."
134,593680,597142,"Those morons who write the books
ought to do some research here."
135,597225,599769,"Isn't Fuzzy just
underdeveloped?"
136,599853,602022,"When doesn't
he have bronchitis?"
137,602105,606443,"I wouldn't call his bronchial
infection underdeveloped, would you?"
138,606526,609321,"- [Coughing]

come out here, please?"
144,624711,627839,There you go.
145,627922,631635,"- Hi, Homer.
- Hey. What is it, Mary Agnes?"
146,631718,635555,[Larch] Now calm down.
147,635639,639559,"- What is it?
- Look."
148,639643,642896,"Oh. Uh, did you bite it?"
149,644648,647525,"- Did you bite your tongue?
- I don't remember."
150,649235,653573,"Uh, yeah. That looks like you bit it.
You'll be fine."
151,653657,657744,"Well, maybe I was kissing
someone and he bit me."
152,657827,660914,"Oh, I think you bit it. Maybe
in your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy."
153,660997,665001,"O Lord, support us
all the day long..."

936,4221099,4223643,"If the little ones
want to know what happened,"
937,4223727,4228023,"tell them that Fuzzy
was adopted."
938,4229899,4234446,"- Okay.
- So, what happened to Fuzzy?"
939,4235530,4237991,"- He was adopted.
- Good."
940,4246416,4249252,"- Will they believe that, you think?
- They'll believe it..."
941,4249336,4251671,"because they
want to believe it."
942,4255008,4259095,"- Shouldn't we tell Homer?
- If Homer wanted to know
what was happening here,"
943,4259179,4262974,"he could pick up
the telephone and call us."
944,4263058,4268188,"I think it was a nurse or a nanny
who, uh, who adopted Fuzzy."
945,4268271,4270982,"Someone who could
take care of him."
946,4271066,4274736,"Because they had a better
breathing machine..."

built for him."
948,4277113,4281076,"[Buster] So I think we should be
happy for Fuzzy, okay?"
949,4283370,4287999,"He found a family.

- Oh, thank you."
955,4306643,4311523,"Rose, I brought those clothes for you.
Come on. Let's go see if they fit."
956,4313149,4316236,"- What's that?
- [Metal Rattling]"
957,4318863,4322867,"- Oh, ain't you gonna open it, Homer?
- No."

now, Peaches."

have the occasion to use it,"

I'm enjoying my life here."

when we imagine we have..."
1024,4749544,4752714,"something terrible to hide
from those who love us."
1025,4756092,4760347,"- Homer?
- Do you think it's not obvious
to us what's happened to you?"
1026,4760430,4762724,"You've fallen in love,
haven't you?"
1027,4764684,4768813,"By the way, whatever you're up to can't
be too good for your heart."
1028,4768897,4773068,"Then again, it's the sort
of condition that could be
made worse by worrying about it,"
1029,4773151,4775236,"so don't worry
about it."

1156,5409496,5413541,"- What? Are you sure?
- I can't believe this."
1157,5413625,5417087,"I knew there was something wrong.
What is she gonna do?"
1158,5419214,5423301,"God, I can't believe it. We have to
keep her away from that bastard."
1159,5434646,5437315,"- Mr Rose?
- Homer."
1160,5437399,5441152,"I know you ain't ready
for lunch, boy. [Chuckles]"
1161,5442696,5445907,"- Is it, uh, true?
- What's that?"
1162,5445991,5448618,"Uh, are you..."
1163,5449828,5451830,"sleeping with
your own daughter?"
1164,5474436,5477480,"I think you've been staying up
too late at night, Homer."
1165,5486823,5488825,"You're having sex
with your own daughter."
1166,5488908,5492704,"Ain't nobody havin' sex with my
daughter! Let me just tell you that."
1167,5492787,5496708,"You're lying. Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?"
1168,5500128,5502130,"What do you care
who hears?"
1169,5502213,5504966,"I mean, come on.
They know already, don't they?"
1170,5505050,5508970,"- They know, Mr Rose.
- And you know
what your business is, boy!"
1171,5509054,5512474,"I know you don't wanna be
in no kind of business with me!"
1172,5512557,5516353,"- That's what I know.
- Yeah? Go on. Cut my clothes.
I've got other clothes."
1173,5516436,5519689,"You gonna come here talkin'
to me about lies and shame?"
1174,5519773,5522692,"Those people took you in, and
that boy Wally is away at war!"
1175,5522776,5525862,"- Yeah, well, she's your daughter!
- And I love her!"
1176,5528031,5530325,"Ain't never gonna do
nothin' to harm her."
1177,5536915,5538917,"She's pregnant, you know that?
She's pregnant."
1178,5548593,5550720,"[Gulps, Clears Throat]"
1179,5596516,5599394,No! No!
1180,5604774,5607193,"[Man] He was over Burma
when he was shot down."
1181,5607277,5611031,"There were no injuries
from the crash, just disease."
1182,5611114,5615952,"When the plane was hit, the crew chief
and the radioman jumped close together."
1183,5616036,5620165,"The co-pilot jumped third,
all on Captain Worthington's orders."
1184,5620248,5623835,"- Come in.
- The captain was still flying the plane."
1185,5623918,5627547,"None of the men on the ground
could see the sky. That's
how thick the jungle was."
1186,5627630,5631801,"They never saw the plane crash.
They never heard it crash."
1187,5631885,5635180,"They never saw Captain
Worthington's parachute either."
1188,5635263,5637474,"But he was missing
for 20 days. Why?"
1189,5637557,5642187,"He followed the Irrawaddy River
all the way to Rangoon."
1190,5642270,5646149,"He managed to avoid the Japs
but not the mosquitoes."
1191,5647317,5649319,So it's malaria.
1192,5649402,5651613,"It's, um,
encephalitis ""B."""
1193,5651696,5653865,[Olive] What's that?
1194,5653948,5658244,"Captain Worthington is paralysed
from the waist down."
1195,5658328,5660455,He... He won't walk.
1196,5669756,5673259,"- I'm sorry.
- When is he coming home?"
1197,5673343,5677055,"In about a month.
By the end of October."
1198,5693029,5695532,"[Homer] Just tell me.
I'll do whatever you wanna do."
1199,5696616,5698660,Nothing.
1200,5700954,5703081,"Isn't that like
waiting and seeing?"
1201,5706084,5710338,"No.
Nothing's nothing."
1202,5715176,5717220,"I want Wally
to come home."
1203,5720682,5723226,I'm afraid to see him too.
1204,5723310,5727188,"- I know.
- Oh, don't do that, Homer."
1205,5733695,5736573,"I just want to sit here
and do nothing."
1206,5740327,5742620,[Homer] To do nothing.
1207,5744080,5747292,"It's a great idea,
really."
1208,5747375,5750920,"Maybe if I just
wait and see long enough,"
1209,5751004,5754716,"then I won't have to do anything
or decide anything, you know?"
1210,5754799,5757844,"I mean, maybe if
I'm lucky enough,"
1211,5757927,5761890,"someone else will decide and choose
and do things for me."
1212,5763016,5765101,"What are you
talking about?"
1213,5767604,5771733,"But then again,
maybe I won't be that lucky."
1214,5774527,5778490,"And it's not my fault.
It's not your fault."
1215,5780575,5785288,"And that's just it. Someone's gonna
get hurt, and it's no one's fault."
1216,5785372,5789000,"- I don't want to talk about this.
- If we just sit here..."
1217,5789084,5792253,"and we wait and see
a little while longer,"
1218,5792337,5796299,"then maybe you won't have to choose,
and I won't have todo anything!"
1219,5796383,5800428,"What do you want from me?
Wally's been shot down. He's paralysed."
1220,5800512,5802472,"What do you
want me to do?"
1221,5802555,5805850,Nothing. I'm sorry.
