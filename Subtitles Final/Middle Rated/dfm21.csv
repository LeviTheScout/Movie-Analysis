87,356273,358108,but I feel like
88,358191,359276,a fraud.
89,359359,360652,You understand I'm a...
90,361778,363113,"pediatrician,"
91,365115,366825,right?
92,366908,368910,"I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended"

98,377419,378980,"And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,"
99,379004,380880,but it sounds to me like
100,380964,383717,"you're experiencing
imposter syndrome."
101,383800,387012,"And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,"
102,387095,389514,"so if you don't mind me asking,"
103,389598,391558,"how well do you remember
your childhood?"

105,394060,395937,"Trauma? Uh, I don't know."
106,396021,397480,"I mean, I never met my dad."
107,397564,400942,"Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival."
108,401026,402545,"I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,"
109,402569,403612,"ran away from 11 homes,"
110,403695,404904,got into a lot of fights.
111,404988,406197,Then I was abducted by a wizard
112,406281,407741,who gave me superpowers
113,407824,409468,"and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face."
114,409492,410660,That's not a small amount.
115,410744,412120,A doctor conjured seven demons
116,412203,413580,"and held my whole family
hostage,"
117,413663,415099,"so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,"
118,415123,416833,"and then everybody
got superpowers,"
119,416916,418686,"but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing"
120,418710,420396,"and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together."
121,420420,423340,"Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that."
122,423423,425884,"Right?
Rejected by your parents,"
123,425967,427469,"then by the system,"
124,427552,430180,"and now rejected by a city
you try to protect."
125,430263,431848,"I never said I was rejected
by my city."
126,433808,435393,"""Rejected by city."""
127,435477,437354,"That's the Tribune.

128,437437,440106,"- I do.
- Anyway, okay, well, um..."
129,440190,442859,"I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems."
130,442942,447447,"There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so..."

179,546713,547857,We should see it performed live.

- No, seriously."

a ponytail and glasses"
351,1087086,1088546,"and, like, nobody recognizes her"
352,1088629,1090065,"and she's, like, an accountant
or something?"
353,1090089,1092550,"Just stop.
You are holding on too tight."
354,1092633,1095344,"Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes"
355,1095428,1097847,"doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom."
356,1097930,1099765,Or me wanting to go to college
357,1099849,1101309,means I'm abandoning the family.
358,1101392,1102852,"Oh. Okay, cool,"
359,1102935,1104812,"it's about college again.
I totally get it."
360,1104895,1106022,Yeah.
361,1106105,1107815,Do you really not see yourself?
362,1107898,1108898,[sighs]
363,1114947,1116574,You turn 18 in five months.
364,1116657,1118909,"They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out."

yes, but you're about to age out"

just like I did."
367,1123456,1126125,"Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?"
368,1126208,1127208,Do you?
369,1128586,1131088,"Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent."
370,1131172,1134008,"And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me"
371,1134091,1136093,"and soon there will be
no checks for you."
372,1137511,1140806,"I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job."
373,1140890,1142475,I want to contribute.

what you took?"

395,1248914,1251333,The power of elements.

to prevent your kind"

398,1257089,1259258,"The only way that barrier
could be removed is if..."

you know someone cool,"

make you cool."

You know?"
536,1643559,1644679,That I'm gonna let you down.
537,1649565,1651733,"You know what?
Screw it. Let's try."
538,1651817,1652985,Let's try this crazy thing.
539,1654319,1655319,"Maybe we'll, uh..."
540,1657990,1659575,seal it with a kiss?
541,1659658,1661618,"[sentimental piano music
playing]"
542,1673297,1674673,"- Billy Batson!
- [Shazam screams]"
543,1674756,1676967,You are a fool of a champion.
544,1677050,1679094,"What the hell...
What the hell is going on?"
545,1679177,1680488,"What happened
to her beautiful face?"
546,1680512,1682139,"Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?"
547,1682222,1684391,"I bring a warning
from beyond your realm."
548,1684474,1686393,"The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you."
549,1686476,1687644,Daughters of Atlas?
550,1687728,1689146,"They're coming to unmake
your world"
551,1689229,1692107,"and torture mankind
for all eternity"
552,1692190,1694860,"- in the Pit of Endless Agony.
- Okay, I feel like maybe"
553,1694943,1696045,"I should be writing
all this down."
554,1696069,1697195,"- Quiet!
- Okay, okay."
555,1697279,1699197,You don't know what you've done.
556,1699281,1701241,I regret ever choosing you.
557,1701325,1702951,"Because of you,"
558,1703035,1705054,"the barrier between the world
has been brought down."
559,1705078,1706580,"They will be hunting
for you now."
560,1706663,1707663,Hunting your family.
561,1710709,1712085,[Shazam] Hmm?
562,1712169,1715005,"Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy."
563,1715088,1717466,"The fate of your world
depends on it."
564,1717549,1719801,"One thing you absolutely
must not allow"
565,1719885,1722095,"the daughters of Atlas
to do is..."
566,1722179,1723597,"- [screams]
- [gasps]"

- [crickets chirping]"
572,1747746,1748746,[sighs]
573,1755170,1758799,"[Freddy] Nope, over it.
Done it."
574,1758882,1761134,"Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me? [gasps]"
575,1762052,1763804,Armored car heist?
576,1763887,1766139,"[chuckles] I think I got that
in the bag."
577,1766223,1768016,[rock music playing]
578,1768100,1769851,"- Shazam!
- [lightning cracks]"
579,1775524,1776524,Whoo!
580,1777359,1778359,[Freddy scoffs]
581,1780028,1781238,Bon appetit.
582,1782739,1784074,Hi.
583,1784157,1786743,"- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi. [chuckles]"
584,1786827,1788161,"Um, you wanna show me"
585,1788245,1790038,"where you were sitting
when it happened?"
586,1792290,1793750,"Oh, yeah, of course. Totally."
587,1793834,1795585,"- Yeah. Follow me.
- Okay, yeah."
588,1795669,1797879,"So, basically,
it's a table down at the end."
589,1797963,1799923,[people chattering]
590,1801967,1803552,"So I was sitting, yeah..."
591,1803635,1806013,"Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting"
592,1806096,1807347,right there.
593,1807431,1808658,"- Here? [chuckles]
- Right there, yeah."
594,1808682,1810600,"[cell phone vibrates, chimes]"
595,1810684,1812227,"Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother."
596,1812310,1814312,"Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister."
597,1814396,1815596,Always has to know where I am.
598,1815647,1816898,"- Right.
- [cell phone chiming]"
599,1816982,1818334,"- I feel that, clearly.
- [chuckles]"
600,1818358,1819901,"Always thinks she knows
better, too."
601,1819985,1821504,"Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?"
602,1821528,1823321,"Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her."
603,1823405,1825574,"No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone..."
604,1825657,1827451,"Constantly breathing
down your neck."
605,1827534,1829345,"- From the moment you wake up!
- 'Cause I'm not a kid anymore."
606,1829369,1831747,"No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly."
607,1831830,1833558,"And do we have to do
every single thing together?"
608,1833582,1835625,[both] No!
609,1835709,1837711,"- [both chuckle]
- [footsteps approaching]"
610,1837794,1839880,Oh! Billy! What...
611,1839963,1841381,What a coinkidink! Um...
612,1841465,1843383,"I was just telling
my friend Anne"
613,1843467,1846261,"- what a great guy you are.
- We need to talk."
614,1846344,1847904,"We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk."
615,1847929,1849681,"- He's a great talker.
- Freddy."
616,1849765,1851975,"I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back. -Okay."
617,1853810,1855896,"Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?"
618,1855979,1857189,The skin peeled off his face.
619,1857272,1859066,"He turned into a literal
pile of ash."
620,1859149,1861234,"- Yeah, seems definitive.
- I dunno."
621,1861318,1864446,"Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams"
622,1864529,1866007,"and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message."
623,1866031,1867759,"[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers."
624,1867783,1869993,"- What's that?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you"
625,1870077,1871846,"- from the great beyond?
- That's it, I'm calling"
626,1871870,1873330,"an emergency meeting
after school."
627,1873413,1875373,"- I want you there.
- Where else am I gonna go?"
628,1875457,1876750,"- What?
- Dude."
629,1876833,1878877,[Freddy reading indistinctly]
630,1878960,1881213,"Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!"
631,1881296,1882857,"All right? It was already
like that and, and, and..."
632,1882881,1884317,"What is that, the Tribune?
It's fake news!"
633,1884341,1885801,"Freddy, we only have one rule."
634,1885884,1887177,[both] All or none.
635,1887260,1888613,"And it's a stupid rule,
by the way."
636,1888637,1890222,"I have a girl talking
to me, Billy."
637,1890305,1892057,"A girl. For the first time
in my life!"
638,1892140,1894077,"And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,"
639,1894101,1895727,but I'll never find out
640,1895811,1897121,"if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!"
641,1897145,1898522,"Just be at the Rock, Freddy."
642,1898605,1901608,[sighs] Okay. Mmm.
643,1901691,1903860,"By the way, uh,
she has a sister."
644,1903944,1905362,Total control freak.
645,1905445,1906863,"I think you guys
would get along."
646,1906947,1908740,"Think you'd love her, actually."
647,1908824,1910009,"[Shazam] Look, look, look. Fam,"
648,1910033,1911493,I know it sounds crazy.
649,1911576,1913203,"And, and obviously I don't know"
650,1913286,1915205,exactly what this all means
651,1915288,1916873,"but, but he was super aggro"
652,1916957,1918976,"and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think."
653,1919000,1920460,He was yelling about all this
654,1920544,1922021,"wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff."
655,1922045,1924631,Do you have to talk so loud?
656,1924714,1926633,"Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud."
657,1926716,1929427,"I think this is
a perfectly acceptable indoor voice volume."
658,1929511,1930887,"What is the deal?
Are you okay?"
659,1930971,1933974,"- Yeah.
- Why do you have sunglasses on?"
660,1934057,1935451,"Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?"
661,1935475,1937227,"- [snorts]
- [Shazam chuckles]"
662,1937310,1939813,"I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,"
663,1939896,1942607,"but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun."
664,1942691,1945652,"In point of fact,
I did have a great time."
665,1945735,1948613,"I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself."
666,1948697,1950949,"You made friends
at the eye doctor?"
667,1951032,1952492,"No, she..."
668,1952576,1954035,"Yeah, can we get back on track?"
669,1954119,1955662,"Listen, he's yelling at me"
670,1955745,1957664,"and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas"
671,1957747,1959624,are coming to hunt us.
672,1959708,1961042,"So, check out what I found."
673,1961126,1962726,"""The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring"
674,1962752,1963962,"of the Titan Atlas..."""

677,1969801,1972137,"Well, good things
can happen at night."
678,1972220,1973805,"- And death.

totally terrifying."

- Dragon!"
690,2000081,2001708,Mary. What are we doin'?
691,2001791,2004502,"I don't know, man.

need to be on the same page"

better than me."

me a tutorial here, guys, okay?"

how a lot of this stuff works."

or that violin"

really need your help."

for information"

isn't it?"

to... Why would they ever come here?"
737,2156821,2158501,"I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by..."
738,2158531,2160367,Do you actually know those guys?

a ""Canadian girlfriend"" situation?"

Well, she and I"

the hot one."

- Him?"

subjective, right? But, um..."
753,2188770,2190814,"Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls"

to make you actually prove it, really."

And I'm gonna"

779,2255753,2257338,"- That's a lot of nice things.
- Yeah."
780,2259299,2260633,How did you two meet?
781,2260717,2261801,Comic Con.
782,2261885,2263803,"- What's Comic Con?
- What?"
783,2263887,2265197,"[superhero Mary]
According to this,"
784,2265221,2267474,"gods considered humans servants,"
785,2267557,2269392,"toys to be played with,"
786,2269476,2270852,children to be punished.
787,2272854,2274481,"[chuckles] Thanks, Steve."
788,2274564,2277025,"Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods."
789,2277108,2278651,"I'm reading about that
right now."
790,2278735,2280320,"So, apparently, all of this"
791,2280403,2282447,"revolves around
a powerful weapon."
792,2282530,2284449,"So Atlas, uh, the father"
793,2284532,2286743,"of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,"
794,2286826,2288666,"he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life"
795,2288703,2291289,"and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities"
796,2291372,2294209,"but also to take powers away
from others."
797,2294292,2297754,"So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power."
798,2297837,2301591,"Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic."
799,2301674,2303218,"But when things got bad,"
800,2303301,2306221,"a council of human wizards
got together and they"
801,2306304,2307639,stole the staff from Atlas.
802,2307722,2309474,"And they used that to take
his powers away."
803,2309557,2311035,"And once they had his magic
they went after other gods..."
804,2311059,2312536,"Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,"
805,2312560,2314395,this is the wizard that I know!
806,2314479,2315605,What do these say?
807,2321236,2322529,"""The Wisdom of Solomon,"
808,2322612,2324239,"Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,"
809,2324322,2325907,"Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,"
810,2325990,2328284,"Speed of Mercury."" These are
the powers they stole."
811,2329619,2330619,No.
812,2332705,2333706,"Whoa, guys, look!"
813,2333790,2335333,This is what the name means.
814,2335416,2336894,"Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,"
815,2336918,2338836,"which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so."
816,2338920,2342048,"If I may point out one
of the powers that may be possibly MIA."
817,2342131,2343591,Boop.
818,2343675,2344717,"[Shazam] I'm sorry,"
819,2344801,2346594,are you very unsubtly implying
820,2346678,2349305,"that I somehow lack
the wisdom of"
821,2349389,2351182,"- Solo Man?
- Yeah."
822,2352225,2353935,"Well, maybe it comes later."
823,2354018,2355937,"I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do."
824,2356020,2357021,"- I'm just saying.
- Yeah."
825,2357105,2358398,"This is very, very hurtful."
826,2358481,2359667,"I just want you all
to know that."
827,2359691,2361109,"And it's pronounced ""Solomon."""
828,2361192,2362569,"- Oh.
- [Shazam clears throat]"
829,2362652,2364320,"What else have we learned, fam?"
830,2364404,2368783,"Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,"
831,2368866,2373162,"the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some"
832,2373246,2375290,magical sphere
833,2375373,2377166,sealing it away forever.
834,2377250,2379419,Cut off from magic.
835,2379502,2381546,"Oh, so that's what
that was about."
836,2381629,2384716,"Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore."
837,2386968,2389053,"A bizarre and gruesome scene
unfolded"
838,2389137,2390847,"in Athens, Greece this morning."
839,2390930,2392992,"Two women dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek..."
840,2393016,2395077,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the wizard's
staff. How did they get that?"
841,2395101,2396853,"So, all those statues
used to be people."
842,2396936,2400857,"I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,"
843,2400940,2402025,where Greece is at?
844,2403818,2407196,"Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane."
845,2407280,2408281,You want it back?
846,2412118,2414245,"I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away."
847,2414329,2416581,"So, that's probably
where the journey started."
848,2416664,2417790,"- You know?
- What?"
849,2417874,2419250,"What do you mean,
""What?"" What?"
850,2419334,2420936,"- You just left it there?
- We were all there."
851,2420960,2423046,"Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers."
852,2423129,2424797,"You're welcome, by the way."
853,2424881,2426191,"And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do"
854,2426215,2428217,"super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?"
855,2428301,2429802,"You broke the staff,"
856,2429886,2431721,"meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds."
857,2431804,2433014,Which we now know.
858,2433097,2434974,"We also now know
what they look like,"
859,2435058,2436827,"so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two"
860,2436851,2437852,"- coming a...
- Three."
861,2437935,2438935,What?
862,2440688,2442482,Atlas had three daughters.
863,2442565,2444859,"Kalypso, Hespera,"
864,2445610,2446694,Anthea.
865,2446778,2449238,Anne... thea.
866,2451699,2454369,"You know, I'm not
just a superhero."
867,2455370,2456663,I'm a super listener.
868,2457705,2459040,And...
869,2459123,2460249,I sense...
870,2461709,2464170,"that you may have feelings
for Freddy."
871,2464253,2466089,"Just wanna know
when he's coming back."
872,2467131,2468633,Don't want him to get hurt.
873,2468716,2471678,"Oh, well, Anne... [sighs]
I mean, we can't choose"
874,2471761,2473429,the people we fall for.
875,2473513,2475056,What?
876,2475139,2476766,I'm not talking about that.
877,2476849,2479602,"If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger."
878,2479686,2481729,Whoa! Look who you're with.
879,2481813,2483398,"What could possibly
be dangerous?"
880,2483481,2484481,Us.
881,2486693,2488361,Okay.
882,2488444,2490029,I see how it is.

888,2498454,2499914,"Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know."
889,2499997,2501416,"I never meant
for you to get hurt."
890,2501499,2503334,"Oh, I'm not the one
who's gonna get hurt."

895,2512093,2513761,"Freddy, are you all right?"
896,2513845,2514762,"Get back inside.
Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle."
897,2514846,2517014,I'm okay. Go back inside.
898,2517098,2518516,"Who are you?
Do you have kids here?"
899,2518599,2519952,"What are you doing?

1274,3610899,3614110,"who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior."
1275,3614194,3616363,"Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you"
1276,3616446,3618406,"'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,"
1277,3618490,3621701,"but I think I have
a few experiences that you don't have."
1278,3621785,3625038,"'Cause I've seen all of the
Fast and the Furious movies, lady."
1279,3625121,3626706,And let me tell you something.
1280,3626790,3629835,It's all about family!

1282,3631753,3634172,"- [music stops]
- [birds cawing]"
1283,3635298,3637467,Family!
1284,3637551,3640679,"Guys, that was the signal. We practiced
this, like, 12 times. Thank you."
1285,3640762,3642764,"Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?"
1286,3644057,3646977,"No, human.
You forgot about mine."

1307,3738151,3739361,[Shazam] Whoo!
1308,3739444,3741071,She sure didn't see that coming
1309,3741154,3745033,"because she didn't go
to the eye doctor. [chuckles]"
1310,3745116,3746826,"[Shazam] Uh, Darla,
that was, 'cause..."
1311,3746910,3749371,"- [rattling]
- A euphemism. That was a euphemism."

1316,3774437,3776940,"And now two more must die,
and for what?"
1317,3777023,3779484,So you can keep playing soldier?

- [chain locks]"
1337,3871785,3873161,You thought you were just goin'
1338,3873244,3874680,"into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?"
1339,3874704,3876873,Which I can somehow still smell.
1340,3876956,3879101,"Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?"
1341,3879125,3880251,"- Yeah.
- Like, permeates"
1342,3880335,3881878,"the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,"
1343,3881961,3883338,welcome to the Rock of Eternity.
1344,3884214,3885632,Only Champions
1345,3885715,3888093,"can get in here,
through any door that we want."
1346,3888176,3890887,"Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't."
1347,3890970,3893473,"Guys, that's what I call
a total success."
1348,3894933,3896893,"Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win."
1349,3896976,3898816,"- Told you I suck at dodgeball.
- [Shazam] Yeah,"
1350,3898895,3900313,"you do, yeah, but you know,"
1351,3900396,3901749,"look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots."
1352,3901773,3903066,You know what I mean?
1353,3903149,3904776,And hers... [chuckles]
1354,3904859,3906402,lack of strategic thinking.
1355,3906486,3908363,Now for the real trade.
1356,3908446,3911783,"Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom."
1357,3911866,3913302,"[superhero Darla] And get rid
of the dome."
1358,3913326,3914410,"[Shazam] Oh, yeah."
1359,3914494,3916621,And get rid of the dome.
1360,3916704,3918248,"'Cause the city
of brotherly love"
1361,3918331,3919499,is gettin' a little moist.
1362,3921960,3923336,"Word choice, man."
1363,3923419,3924480,"[Shazam] Yeah, I regretted it
as soon as"
1364,3924504,3926131,it was coming out of my mouth.
1365,3926214,3927132,"[Super Hero Eugene] It's just
one of those words..."
1366,3927215,3928255,[Shazam] I know. I just...
1367,3932554,3935140,"""Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."""
1368,3935223,3936891,"- Burn!
- [chuckles]"
1369,3936975,3938226,I just came up with that.
1370,3938309,3939537,"Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,"
1371,3939561,3941437,so it's really clear. Okay.
1372,3941521,3943881,"[clears throat] Man, it's so
good having Steve cover grammar"
1373,3943940,3946221,"and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound so much smarter."
1374,3947110,3948987,[clears throat] So...
1375,3949070,3951030,"""A brother for a sister, huh?"
1376,3951114,3952740,How's that feel?
1377,3952824,3955618,"Also, how are you
actually sisters,"
1378,3955702,3958413,"because the age difference
is very noticeable,"
1379,3958496,3961708,"and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."""
1380,3961791,3964127,"Even though I don't like you
very much,"
1381,3964210,3966087,"I believe everyone
deserves human rights,"
1382,3966171,3967881,"but you don't deserve
strawberry."
1383,3967964,3970800,You only get yellow. [gasps]
1384,3973219,3974219,She's gone!
1385,3975930,3976973,"Wait, what?"
1386,3977056,3979017,[dramatic music playing]
1387,3987901,3989694,"I thought we brought her in
too easily."
1388,3989777,3991779,She wanted to get caught.
1389,3991863,3995241,"I don't get it.
Where would she even go?"
1390,3995325,3996325,[clanking]
1391,3998244,3999244,[door creaks]
1392,4004459,4006836,"Well, this seemed inevitable."
1393,4013426,4016179,"Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo."
1394,4016262,4019349,"We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?"
1395,4019432,4020975,I don't know.
1396,4021059,4023353,"You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,"
1397,4023436,4025396,"you know nothing about magic,
you're just..."
1398,4029025,4030109,You're the wizard.
1399,4030193,4032362,"- Thank you.
- Whatever."
1400,4032445,4035114,"Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours can be trusted."
1401,4039077,4041037,[tense music playing]
1402,4048294,4049494,"- [door unlocks]
- [Freddy gasps]"
1403,4050380,4052632,"Get back, get back. Get back."
1404,4062809,4064769,[whispering in other language]
1405,4069607,4070607,[Hespera gasps]
1406,4080952,4082513,"[in English] Okay,
I think the coast is clear. Let's go home."
1407,4082537,4083871,One moment.
1408,4083955,4086291,"Did you not see
what she was holding?"
1409,4086374,4088042,"It was an apple.
She wanted a snack."
1410,4088126,4089419,What's the big deal?
1411,4089502,4092755,"The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life."
1412,4092839,4094590,From the Tree of Life.
1413,4094674,4096955,"Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?"
1414,4098845,4101264,"- Billy!
- Billy. Gosh."
1415,4101347,4102347,[wizard groans]
1416,4103975,4104975,Where are you going now?
1417,4109897,4110897,[inhales sharply]
1418,4112191,4114819,[exhales] Nope.
1419,4114902,4115902,She's not in there.
1420,4116988,4118197,Nope.
1421,4118281,4119907,"No, no, no.
That's a hard pass."
1422,4119991,4122011,"- That's a hard pass.
- [Super Hero Eugene] Yo, Billy,"
1423,4122035,4123494,"you don't gotta worry
about that one."
1424,4123578,4125264,"It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere."
1425,4125288,4126956,"- [sniffs]
- Like an ancient Greek"
1426,4127040,4128160,"- labyrinth?
- [Shazam] Guys..."
1427,4129125,4131336,[sniffs] porta-potty.
1428,4131419,4133087,"- [sniffs]
- [Super Hero Eugene] Mmm."
1429,4142388,4143431,Hespera.
1430,4148978,4151439,"It's over, sisters."
1431,4151522,4154025,"Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm."
1432,4155651,4158780,Or we plant it in their realm.
1433,4158863,4162200,"But that would destroy
their world."
1434,4162283,4164577,Just as they destroyed ours.
1435,4164660,4166788,[Hespera] You can't be serious.
1436,4166871,4168664,"- Yes.
- [Anthea] No."
1437,4168748,4170208,"No, that's not
what we agreed to."
1438,4170291,4171959,"[Kalypso] Anthea,
you simpering bore."
1439,4172043,4173586,"[Hespera] She's right,
we've spent ages"
1440,4173669,4175129,waiting for this moment.
1441,4175213,4176547,[Anthea] We have the seed.
1442,4176631,4178508,"We have the staff
and its powers."
1443,4178591,4179967,"[Hespera]
We are not squandering it"
1444,4180051,4181844,for your personal satisfaction.
1445,4181928,4184889,"[whispering]
No, I should go, not you."
1446,4184972,4186933,"Look, I know
what you're thinking."
1447,4187016,4189286,"The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly sing ""sneak thief."""
1448,4189310,4191705,"But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy when you walk."
1449,4191729,4192980,"- It's pathetic.
- [knees crack]"
1450,4193064,4194107,See?
1451,4195233,4196609,"Fortune be with you, Freddy."
1452,4196692,4198778,"Thank you.
What did you just call me?"
1453,4199737,4202365,Freddy. Freddy Freeman.
1454,4202448,4205827,"[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it."
1455,4205910,4207453,I'll see you on the other side.
1456,4208996,4210432,"[Hespera] Even if we did,
the Tree of Life"
1457,4210456,4212125,would not thrive in their soil.
1458,4212208,4215294,"It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something..."
1459,4215378,4216712,[Kalypso] Monstrous?
1460,4216796,4219173,That is what humans are.
1461,4219257,4222176,"It is only fitting
that we bring our monsters to their world"
1462,4222260,4224720,"and do to them
as they did to us."
1463,4227849,4230017,"[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance"
1464,4230101,4233563,"and vengeance has
great measure of weight on those scales."
1465,4233646,4236649,"Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves."
1466,4236732,4238609,"- No, not all.
- All."
1467,4238693,4242155,"[Hespera] Sister, I fear your
rage has gotten the better of you."
1468,4242238,4243406,[Kalypso] Why?
1469,4243489,4245825,"Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,"
1470,4245908,4248035,"then pray to the gods
to absolve them."
1471,4248119,4250413,"They actually pray
for order and peace"
1472,4250496,4253624,"when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn."
1473,4253708,4255918,"Anthea, I want you
to take the apple"
1474,4256002,4258087,and plant it in our garden.
1475,4259505,4260923,"[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her."
1476,4261007,4262675,"Father would be ashamed
of both of you."
1477,4262758,4264469,"- [object clatters]
- [Freddy yelps]"
1478,4264552,4266345,Where did that even come from?
1479,4268014,4269891,"- Hi!
- You favor her, Hespera,"
1480,4269974,4271559,and see how she betrays us.
1481,4275313,4276832,"Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister."
1482,4276856,4278983,"- No!
- [Kalypso] Kill him!"
1483,4282570,4284197,What is that?
1484,4284280,4286073,"[Shazam] Great question.
No idea."
1485,4287158,4288743,But made you look.
1486,4288826,4289994,Billy! [chuckles]
1487,4291787,4293539,"- Oh!
- Oh."
1488,4293623,4295333,"- [Freddy gasps]
- Your crutch!"
1489,4295416,4298336,"- Oh! Shazam!
- [lightning cracks]"
1490,4298419,4299419,"- Yes!
- No!"
1491,4303508,4305343,"So, we have a lot to talk about."
1492,4315520,4317730,"Kalypso, hand me the staff."
1493,4319649,4321234,You are not fit to wield it.
1494,4321317,4322652,More fit than you.
1495,4322735,4324415,"You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing."
1496,4324445,4327782,"Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,"
1497,4327865,4329909,"but everyone here
has become weak."
1498,4331035,4333204,"Ladon, world-eater,"
1499,4334121,4336582,rise from the pit!
1500,4336666,4338626,[clanking]
1501,4341003,4342922,[Ladon roars]
1502,4345341,4347051,"[Shazam] Go, go, go!"
1503,4347134,4348445,"[superhero Darla]
Captain Everypower! Where's he going?"
1504,4348469,4349762,[Super Hero Eugene] What the...
1505,4349845,4351514,"- [superhero Mary screams]
- [Ladon roars]"
1506,4353599,4355351,[all screaming]

1508,4359230,4362024,[snoring]
1509,4362108,4364068,[superheroes chattering faintly]
1510,4365403,4366403,[Rosa] Victor?
1511,4367196,4368531,"Victor, wake up."
1512,4368614,4371826,"Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?"
1513,4371909,4373452,Dad. We gotta go!

I know what this looks like."

an acknowledgement of that stupid nickname"

Now can you pick up the pace?"

the wrong champion, man."

say ""all or none,"" right?"

I'm nothing."

what must be done."
1665,4974386,4977931,"I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion"
1666,4979725,4981602,"and no one was worthy
of what I once shared"
1667,4981685,4984146,with my brothers and sisters.
1668,4984229,4985939,"But when you shared your powers,"
1669,4987399,4988775,you did not hesitate.
1670,4988859,4991153,"For you, everyone can be worthy"
1671,4991236,4992738,if given a chance.

these things away"
1680,5014384,5017095,"from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?"
1681,5017179,5018931,"Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy."

by a dragon,"
1693,5055050,5056760,"I'm not gonna force you
to keep me."

1695,5059137,5060847,I know I age out soon.

from the bottom of my heart,"

like we could"

a good addition to the team,"

they're boots,"

they're new."

to break them in yet. -Shut up."
2233,7226136,7229139,"Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,"

in my life."
2241,7249534,7250928,"I don't know who
you're talking about."
2242,7250952,7252454,But I'd like to meet that person

And funny."
2244,7254372,7257167,"And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,"
2245,7257250,7258710,"but, like, in a dangerous way."
2246,7258793,7260628,"What the hell
are you talking about?"
2247,7260712,7262797,Relax. We know who you are.
2248,7262881,7265008,"- How?
- Don't worry about that."
2249,7266092,7267093,Who are you guys?
2250,7267177,7268470,Don't worry about that either.
2251,7268553,7270305,"Look, we've seen
what you can do."
2252,7270388,7272015,"And we're here
to make you an offer."
2253,7272098,7273141,How would you like to join
2254,7273224,7274350,"- the Justice...
- Yes!"
2255,7274434,7275852,A thousand times yes!
2256,7275935,7277770,"Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!"
2257,7277854,7279772,"Well, I mean, not this exactly."
2258,7279856,7280916,"Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman"
2259,7280940,7282108,"in the dream, but..."
2260,7282192,7283610,"- Ew.
- Huh?"
2261,7283693,7285820,"Well, that was easy."
2262,7285904,7287405,Welcome to the Justice Society.
2263,7287489,7289449,"Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?"
2264,7289532,7290783,The Justice Society?
2265,7290867,7292261,"Is that different
than the Justice League?"
2266,7292285,7293912,Yes. The Justice Society
2267,7293995,7295395,"is different
than the Justice League"
2268,7295455,7297207,because of how words work.
2269,7297290,7299167,"I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group."
2270,7299250,7301461,"- So, that's you guys, right?
- No."
2271,7301544,7303463,"Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?"
2272,7303546,7305381,"He's joking, right?"
2273,7305465,7308718,"- No?
- Okay. I'm out."
2274,7308801,7310762,"I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes."
2275,7310845,7312805,Can you drive by and get me?
2276,7312889,7315308,"[Shazam] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism."
2277,7315391,7316702,"It's pretty confusing
that there are"
2278,7316726,7318686,"two separate groups
of superheroes"
2279,7318770,7320230,"that are totally unaffiliated,"
2280,7320313,7322315,"but both have ""Justice""
in their name, you know."
2281,7322398,7324502,"Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing a rebranding of sorts?"
