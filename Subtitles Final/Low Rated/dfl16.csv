is less than a month away."
15,313079,314603,I know. I know.
16,321187,322779,Watch this hand.
17,336769,338236,You see how easy?
18,340006,341098,Yeah.
19,343409,345172,I've been meaning to talk to you.
20,345812,347609,"You know, I've been thinking, and..."
21,349148,352140,"I just... I don't know if I'm cut out
to play piano anymore."
22,353152,356986,"Aubrey, all artists feel that way. It's normal."
23,357090,359558,"No, I... I want to quit."
24,360360,363796,"I mean, I barely made my winter admit
to Yale, and I could still blow it."
25,364764,367790,"I just need to concentrate
all of my efforts into writing."
26,367900,370960,"But you have a gift, an innate talent."
27,371070,373300,You won the Young Artist Competition.
28,373406,376034,"I mean, how much more validation
do you need?"
29,376142,378804,"That was a long time ago, Mr. Norquist."

36,469001,470969,Where'd you find a blue rose?
37,471070,474471,I passed a place on the street. Here.
38,474574,475871,Thank you.
39,481113,482375,You okay?
40,484050,485142,Yeah.
41,486319,487513,Got me.
42,503035,506061,"Sheriff, several federal agents
were seen entering city hall"
43,506172,508606,"- about an hour ago.
- Why has the coroner's report been sealed?"
44,508708,509936,"- Sheriff! Jennifer Toland...
- Please."
45,510042,511066,...disappeared almost two months ago.
46,511177,512804,Serial killers typically...
47,512912,515472,"We have one dead girl,
and you're talking serial killer!"
48,515581,518709,"- You people astound me.
- Could you just give us a name?"
49,519519,522249,Who has not yet found the aortic arches?
50,524991,527391,And the super-pharyngeal ganglia?
51,528394,529486,The brain.
52,530263,532857,"Yes, you can barely see that,
even under the microscope."
53,536936,538096,Is that all I am to you?
54,538204,540229,"Just something to relax you
before the game?"
55,540339,543035,"If I cut a worm in half,
will it become two worms?"
56,543142,545303,"No, Pete, that's a myth."
57,546479,549880,"What's it gonna take for me and you
to be together?"
58,549982,552041,A lot more than one blue rose.
59,552151,555143,"Aubrey, I think I'm falling in love with you."
60,556222,559214,"We barely know each other, Jerrod."
61,559325,561384,"- You're delusional.
- No, I'm not."
62,561494,564361,I've never felt this way about a girl before.
63,564463,565862,"- I just keep thinking about you and...
- Jerrod!"
64,565965,569628,"Can you point out for me
the female reproductive organs?"
65,570536,571764,The seminal receptacles.
66,571871,573668,"Yes, I can, actually."
67,577777,578869,That should be it.
68,583282,586274,"Those would be
the male reproductive organs."
69,589655,592920,"The female organs are at the other end
of the worm."
70,595628,598620,"Looks like you need a little more experience
in the female anatomy."
71,601300,603200,"- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry."
72,612778,615713,"Jennifer Toland's body was discovered
early this morning."
73,616949,620680,"Please don't ask me any questions.
I don't have the details."
74,626926,632193,"Nineteen-year-old female, 5'4 "" tall."
75,637370,640931,"Amputation of individual digits,"
76,641040,643668,possibly on the same or successive days.
77,644944,649278,"Full metacarpal amputation
approximately two weeks later."
78,652785,655845,Ragged cuts indicate
79,655955,661689,"near-lethal levels of amphetamines
inducing a state of forced alertness,"
80,661794,665662,suggesting the killer wanted the victim
81,665765,668563,fully conscious during each limb removal.
82,744710,748806,"As we all know,
Jennifer Toland's body was found this week."
83,749448,752281,And we'd like to take a moment of silence.
84,758491,762325,"Now, let's get out there
and win this one for Jennifer Toland!"
85,774907,776340,Come on!
86,819685,821710,Curfew is one hour away.
87,821821,825951,"Attention, curfew, for under 21,
begins in one hour."
88,828761,829853,Why are you...
89,829962,831759,"Just marry him
and start popping out babies."
90,831864,834890,"No way. I'm done sleeping with guys
I'm not in love with."
91,835000,837901,"Oh, like you were some kind
of a sex addict before."
92,838003,839265,But Jerrod loves you.
93,839371,844070,"I'll be 3,000 miles away in January.
I mean, I can't afford to fall in love."
94,844176,845143,That's nice.
95,845244,849237,"It's like someone could stab you
and you'd never even know what..."
96,849348,851714,It's like Mardi Gras or something.
97,851817,856015,"Yeah, I read this story about this killer
who sits behind people in movies"
98,856121,858851,and stabs them with a needle right here.
99,858958,860619,You die like instantly.
100,860726,863593,"Nobody even knows you're dead
until the movie's over and you don't get up."
101,863696,865027,It's so creep...
102,865130,869328,"Beat them, baby! Owls, number one!
Let's do this! Yeah!"
103,869435,870402,"Oh, my God!"
104,870502,872595,"Oh, so weird!"
105,872705,874502,Everybody is insanely crazy.
106,874607,877098,"- Hey!
- Hey!"
107,877209,878642,I'm looking for Jerrod.
108,878744,881372,"- Oh, good luck.
- Oh, there he is! Jerrod!"
109,881480,883141,"- Jerrod!
- Aubrey, wait!"
110,883249,885979,I'll meet you in front of the Fremont at 11:45.
111,886518,887712,Jerrod!
112,914146,915340,Aubrey?
113,917483,918677,Aubrey!
114,920619,921813,Aubrey!
115,923622,926182,"Okay, so I am officially freaking out."
116,926292,929193,"I'm just gonna try her cell again,
and you've got to try Jerrod."
117,929295,930387,Okay.
118,934600,937694,"- I think it's coming from over here!
- Don't hang up your phone!"
119,937803,939395,"- Hello? Hey.
- It's me."
120,939505,941029,Where's Aubrey?
121,941840,942898,What?
122,944910,947344,"Okay, where did she park?"
123,947446,949277,Where'd she park her car?
124,949381,951713,"- Come on, you rode with her.
- Yeah, it was on that street."
125,951817,954581,"- It's that street, you know the one.
- No. No, I don't know the one."
126,954687,956314,"- Tell me.
- Yeah, I do. It's in front"
127,956422,959482,"- of the little art gallery with the gate.
- Yeah."
128,959758,961555,"- Wait!
- Wait a second!"
129,964897,967058,There it is! There's her car!
130,1051517,1052745,Help!
131,1052851,1053875,No!
132,1056755,1057779,No!
133,1064530,1066361,She...
134,1066465,1068433,She lives on this thing.
135,1069234,1070724,It's her life.
136,1072438,1073666,Writing.
137,1075007,1076736,She loves to write.
138,1078243,1081269,"Mr. Fleming, I'm gonna have to
take that computer from you."
139,1081380,1083041,I need to make a copy of the hard drive.
140,1083148,1085639,"Take it, please. Anything you need."
141,1094827,1096089,"Daniel,"
142,1097096,1100224,"is there any chance
that your daughter might have run away?"
143,1100332,1103699,Was she unhappy about anything?
144,1103802,1105394,Aubrey? Unhappy?
145,1108740,1109707,No.
146,1110876,1112173,Not at all.
147,1112711,1113871,You sure about that?
148,1115681,1118616,"Where were you
when Aubrey left for the game?"
149,1120319,1125586,"I was on a conference call,
so I was in the dining room, pacing."
150,1125691,1128091,"You know, I always pace when I..."
151,1128193,1130821,Do you remember saying goodbye to her?
152,1132631,1135156,Can you describe how she looked?
153,1135267,1136928,What her mood was?
154,1148614,1150946,"You know, you don't always"
155,1151049,1152573,"think to take a mental picture
of your daughter"
156,1152684,1154982,every time she leaves the house.
157,1155454,1157388,"I used to do that, but..."
158,1158957,1161585,"""The Worrier,"" Daniel used to call me."
159,1167766,1169393,Do you have kids?
160,1175908,1177773,"It falls away, and..."
161,1180846,1182780,They always come back.
162,1182881,1186044,"You know, they never don't come back.
It just..."
163,1298930,1300056,Aubrey!
164,1305270,1306464,Aubrey!
165,1324523,1326388,Keep your eyes peeled!
166,1357155,1359749,"3:00 sharp? Yeah, good man."
167,1362861,1364726,Jesus.
168,1364830,1368095,"Well, I hope our little investigation
doesn't interfere with bingo night."
169,1398363,1400729,"I feel like half a person, you know?"
170,1400832,1404233,"And, all of a sudden, it dawns on me,
this is Steve and Vicky."
171,1404336,1406702,"Steve and Vicky this, Steve and Vicky that."
172,1406805,1410036,We're finishing each other's sentences here.
173,1410142,1413077,"Hell, we're finishing each other's thoughts."
174,1437068,1438126,Hey!
175,1440739,1442001,You okay?
176,1444509,1445567,Hey!
177,1455554,1456646,Yeah?
178,1458390,1459584,Susan!
179,1460692,1462159,Is she alive?
180,1462794,1466389,"- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. How bad?"
181,1480879,1483211,Her blood pressure's increasing.
182,1485150,1486913,"- She's fucking awake.
- For God's sake."
183,1487018,1489043,Increasing her thiopental.
184,1499464,1503127,"Orthopedic saw. Orthopedic saw, now."
185,1512210,1514872,"Well! Hey, beautiful."
186,1516715,1519707,"Nobody expected to see those eyes
for a while."
187,1525457,1528085,"- I'm in the hospital?
- You're safe now."
188,1529261,1532230,What hospital am I in? Where?
189,1534165,1535132,I'll...
190,1535967,1537992,"I'll get the doctor, okay?"
191,1553518,1554780,"Oh, my..."
192,1554886,1556251,"Oh, my God!"
193,1568266,1571360,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
194,1588753,1590118,"Look, the press is asking questions."
195,1590221,1594021,"- Now, I think what we should do...
- No, no, no. No comments, no leaks."
196,1594125,1597185,"Aubrey Fleming is still missing
as far as the world's concerned,"
197,1597295,1599058,"- and I want to keep it that way.
- Everyone at the hospital's"
198,1599164,1601632,"been threatened with dismissal
and obstruction of justice charges"
199,1601733,1603963,if they leak a word of this. We clear?
200,1604069,1606333,Plausible explanations. Okay.
201,1606438,1609839,"Number one, he was done with her.
He left her on the side of the road to die."
202,1609941,1612535,But he didn't count on her will to live.
203,1612644,1614111,I don't buy it.
204,1614212,1616908,"He wasn't done with Aubrey Fleming,
not by a long shot."
205,1617015,1620246,"He only had her for what? 17, 18 days?"
206,1620352,1624379,"The sectioning was just getting started.
Her leg wasn't completely off."
207,1624489,1627424,"And why the hell would he sew her fingers
back onto her hand,"
208,1627525,1628583,"- and her hand back onto...
- But wait a minute."
209,1628693,1630183,"Remember, Jennifer Toland drowned."
210,1631096,1633758,"I mean, now, it's too early
for an accurate profile but..."
211,1634132,1637033,I think the cutting is about punishment.
212,1637135,1639433,"And when the punishment is over,"
213,1639537,1642904,"he finds a way for the death to happen,
so he doesn't have to be there."
214,1643008,1647206,"Now, he doesn't like the dying part,
but he's got to make sure it happens."
215,1648580,1650138,Dying freaks him out.
216,1650248,1651442,I think she escaped.
217,1651549,1654382,"The only answer
that makes any sense to me."
218,1658890,1660414,"Hey, honey pie."
219,1664663,1666324,Sure did miss you.
220,1669734,1674137,"We're gonna have you home in no time,
and we can put all this behind us."
221,1675373,1676362,Home?
222,1676474,1678101,"Isn't that right, Doctor?"
223,1678209,1680302,Aubrey's been very brave.
224,1680412,1683848,"With any luck,
we'll have her out of the ICU tomorrow."
225,1686418,1688682,Who is Aubrey?
226,1692724,1694123,Who are you?
227,1697028,1698757,Who is...
228,1698863,1700660,"- Who is Aubrey?
- No."
229,1702500,1704730,"- Oh, my God.
- I don't..."
230,1704836,1706861,"I just, I don't..."
231,1709040,1712032,"Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Please, don't."
232,1725256,1728020,"Aubrey Fleming,
session number one, 10:30 a.m."
233,1729527,1731358,I'm not Aubrey Fleming.
234,1731463,1732862,Then what should I call you?
235,1732964,1735057,My real name would be nice.
236,1737202,1738965,"Session number one, 10:30 a.m."
237,1740572,1741971,Dakota Moss.
238,1743108,1744507,Listen.
239,1744609,1748545,"I know I may look a little like
this Aubrey chick, or whatever her name is,"
240,1748646,1751877,"but I'm not her, okay? I am not her."
241,1753151,1755210,"Let's get some housekeeping
out of the way first."
242,1756554,1759284,"- Date of birth?
- June 9th, 1988."
243,1760458,1762358,Social Security number?
244,1763394,1764884,I don't have one.
245,1766064,1768464,"Look, when you're raised by a crack addict
who thinks the less"
246,1768566,1771194,"that people know about you, the better,
it kind of sticks."
247,1772303,1775295,"I made up a Social Security number
when I needed one,"
248,1775406,1778705,"but I couldn't keep a job long enough
for that to matter."
249,1778810,1781904,A job? You're fairly young to be working.
250,1782013,1786347,"Yeah, well, I didn't grow up in New Salem.
I grew up in the real world."
251,1788119,1789518,You mentioned your mother.
252,1790054,1791021,Dead.
253,1791322,1792721,How did your mother die?
254,1793158,1794284,O.D.
255,1797162,1798629,How long ago?
256,1802967,1807267,"Six, seven months ago.
We weren't really what you'd call close"
257,1807372,1809704,since she'd started using again.
258,1809808,1814074,"But I could always count on seeing
the palm of her hand on payday."
259,1814179,1818309,"When she didn't come around,
I assumed she was dead."
260,1818416,1821112,Wasn't too hard to see that one coming.
261,1860925,1862449,She was stupid.
262,1864028,1865290,Pathetic.
263,1866631,1868098,And a junkie.
264,1883481,1884914,Did your mother leave you anything?
265,1885583,1887778,Yeah. $11.
266,1898930,1902388,"Tell me something. Why does a shrink need
your Social Security number?"
267,1903701,1905999,I like to have it for my files.
268,1907305,1909273,"You're fuzz, aren't you?"
269,1912010,1913944,I don't want to lie to you.
270,1914045,1917412,"I am a psychiatrist,
but I also do work for the FBI."
271,1917515,1919346,I fucking knew it.
272,1919450,1922146,"It doesn't mean I care any less
for the work we do here."
273,1923288,1927247,"You know, you're wasting your time
because I've got nothing to tell you."
274,1927358,1930725,"In cases like these, there are specific details
that we withhold from the public"
275,1930828,1934889,"to separate the serial confessors
from the serial killer."
276,1934999,1938093,"The pattern of your injuries is identical.
Not similar,"
277,1939570,1942539,"identical, with another young girl."
278,1942640,1944972,"A murdered girl, from New Salem."
279,1947078,1948340,Prove it.
280,1961059,1962492,"Oh, my God."
281,1965029,1966792,"Hello, Mrs. Fleming."
282,1968466,1969524,Hey.
283,1970601,1972034,Hi.
284,1972136,1975867,"I brought some of your things
to make you feel more at home."
285,1977141,1982010,This is Mr. Gervais.
286,1989587,1990952,All right.
287,1991055,1995458,"Look, I'm sure you're a very nice woman.
Really. But I don't have a home."
288,1995560,1998996,"And, yeah, I just want to know
when I get to get out of here."
289,1999097,2004194,"You don't remember Mr. Gervais
and sleeping with him?"
290,2006170,2007262,Nope.
291,2012043,2013874,And this is some of your...
292,2014078,2018481,"Some... Some of Aubrey's favorite music,
on that."
293,2019350,2021944,"Now, where are... Shit."
294,2022987,2025080,How could I forget the earphones?
295,2026591,2029492,This was the most important thing in here.
296,2029594,2032085,"You love your music, and, you know,"
297,2032196,2035688,"they use music to help
people come out of comas."
298,2035800,2038394,Do I look like I'm in a fucking coma?
299,2045977,2048036,What else you got in the bag?
300,2048146,2050307,What's that? Is it a picture?
301,2050415,2051404,Yeah.
302,2051549,2054916,"Dr. Mancuso to the ER.
Dr. Mancuso to the ER."
303,2055019,2056111,Here.
304,2061392,2062620,Where...
305,2063961,2065326,Who gave you this?
306,2065696,2066993,Is something happening?
307,2068833,2070164,"When I was a little girl, I..."
308,2070268,2072793,You were seven.
309,2072904,2075429,We all went to Hawaii for Christmas.
310,2077909,2081310,The pictures are almost the same.
311,2082747,2086114,"My bathing suit was different,
the water wasn't blue."
312,2087285,2089583,"It was brown, actually."
313,2089687,2091848,And my mother took me there
314,2091956,2094151,as if it was some sort of treat or something
315,2094692,2096751,to watch freaking garbage float.
316,2102700,2104327,"What is it, honey?"
317,2106604,2109402,"A lot of little girls look alike, I guess."
318,2114212,2115611,What's this?
319,2120251,2122276,You've got to understand that we are trying
320,2122386,2124718,"- to help your daughter, Mrs. Fleming.
- This is what you call help?"
321,2124822,2127655,"- This isn't help. This is just more torture.
- I have full authority"
322,2127758,2129225,"- to conduct this investigation...
- Don't!"
323,2129327,2131352,"...in any way I see fit.
- You do not have full authority."
324,2131462,2133589,"- I'm trying to prevent it happening...
- Hasn't she suffered enough?"
325,2133698,2135393,"...to another girl and mother...
- Are you just trying..."
326,2135500,2136626,"...because it will...
...to prolong our pain?"
327,2136734,2139703,"...Mrs. Fleming. It will.
- My God, where is your sympathy?"
328,2139804,2142796,"Your daughter is lucky to be alive,
but she will not be safe"
329,2142907,2146809,until whoever did this to her is behind bars.
330,2148679,2150203,She's not safe.
331,2177308,2181608,"Dakota, this is Julie Bascombe
and Phil Lazarus."
332,2181712,2185079,"Yeah, I've seen them around.
Two of my prison guards."
333,2187552,2190487,"The security measures are all
for your own comfort, Dakota."
334,2191489,2194583,"Dakota, who cut you?
That's all we want to know."
335,2196394,2200023,"Look, once he finds out you're still alive,
he's gonna come after you."
336,2200131,2202292,"Now, we've done everything we can
to keep this out of the press,"
337,2202400,2204630,but it's bound to get out sooner or later.
338,2204735,2206794,"So, you're gonna use me as bait,
unless I cooperate."
339,2206904,2208633,Is that what you're saying?
340,2209640,2213770,"Dakota, help us, please.
You saw the pictures of Jennifer."
341,2213878,2217439,"The same person who cut her cut you.
You can't deny that."
342,2219817,2222081,"What do you remember
about the past few weeks?"
343,2224789,2225881,Everything.
344,2225990,2229153,Everything? That's unusual.
345,2229260,2231387,"Dakota, who did this to you?"
346,2232797,2233889,I don't know.
347,2233998,2237024,"- Were you blindfolded?
- You were locked up?"
348,2237134,2239295,"It doesn't matter
if it doesn't make sense to you."
349,2239403,2241633,We'll put the pieces together.
350,2248079,2251139,"All right, so I got this new job. Night shift."
351,2252750,2254377,What kind of job?
352,2255419,2257182,A hostess.
353,2257288,2259153,At a gentlemen's club.
354,2260524,2263425,"Don't care how old you really are, kiddo."
355,2263527,2267657,"Your ID says you're 21,
you're fucking 21 to me."
356,2270534,2274436,"An exotic dancer,
that's what the hostess job turned out to be."
357,2381379,2385213,"He could've been there
the first night I danced. I don't know."
358,2580711,2582679,Everything about him was just...
359,2583581,2586573,"I don't know, was intense."
360,2588586,2590110,I never really got to see his face.
361,2590220,2592051,"How do you know it was the same guy
from the club?"
362,2592156,2595648,"- I just knew.
- Was he tall? Thin? Stocky? What?"
363,2599096,2601087,He was wearing blue gloves.
364,2601198,2603826,"- The rubber kind that doctors wear.
- Are you sure?"
365,2603934,2606425,"Look, I'm not sure about anything, okay?"
366,2606537,2608095,What about when he cut you?
367,2608872,2610271,You didn't see him then?
368,2612109,2615704,"- No.
- Look, he gave you drugs, Aubrey. Okay?"
369,2615813,2617246,To make you watch.
370,2617348,2620181,"To keep you awake,
so you'd have to have seen something."
371,2620284,2621376,I don't lie.
372,2622119,2624212,"If I tell you I didn't see him,
I didn't fucking see him."
373,2624321,2626346,"How do you know it was the same guy
who cut you, then?"
374,2626457,2629051,You're right. I don't know.
375,2629159,2632754,"Aubrey, you have got to
stop playing games with us."
376,2632863,2635855,"Am I making myself clear?
We have to know the truth."
377,2635966,2638332,"Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to know the truth?"
378,2638435,2641336,"Well, what about me? You think I don't?"
379,2641438,2643338,How the fuck would you feel?
380,2643440,2647672,"Fingers, leg, hand, gone.
I practically fucking died."
381,2647778,2650975,"And now, I'm locked up
in the fucking hospital"
382,2651081,2653049,like a goddamn prisoner!
383,2682413,2684244,"So, what are you saying, Doctor?"
384,2684348,2688444,"I don't know.
Usually it's easy to find the inconsistencies,"
385,2688552,2689746,the holes in the fantasy.
386,2689853,2692549,"Even in the most extreme cases
of posttraumatic stress,"
387,2692656,2696820,"you get a tiny measure
of the original person."
388,2696927,2699896,"You know what I think, Doctor?
I think we're wasting our time."
389,2699997,2702591,"- I think this kid is lying through her teeth.
- No."
390,2704268,2707169,She's not lying. She's...
391,2712376,2714537,I don't think it's that simple.
392,2714645,2716135,She was withholding deliberately.
393,2716246,2717213,"- Yeah?
- Yeah."
394,2717314,2718941,I thought she just ran out of imagination.
395,2719049,2721108,Aubrey Fleming is not short on imagination.
396,2721218,2722480,"- That's for sure.
- Okay."
397,2722586,2727489,"So, she gets to a certain point in her story
and she stops talking. Why?"
398,2727591,2731254,"Sometimes people create alter egos
to relay information"
399,2731361,2734728,"that their primary personalities
would never reveal."
400,2734832,2737426,"So, why would the alter ego withhold?"
401,2738402,2739369,I don't know.
402,2740270,2742636,"I think she doesn't tell everybody
the whole story"
403,2742740,2744935,"because she doesn't think
anybody's gonna believe her."
404,2745042,2748011,"I mean, she's not even sure
she believes what happened to her."
405,2762059,2765051,"... unconfirmed reports tonight,
in this News 5 exclusive,"
406,2765963,2767521,that the abducted teen has been found
407,2767631,2771123,"and has been secretly held
at New Salem Hospital for over a week."
408,2771235,2772930,"- News 5 will continue to update you...
- Shit."
409,2773036,2775231,... on this story as it develops.
410,2820651,2823176,No. No!
411,2823287,2826017,"No! Get off, get him off me!"
412,2826123,2829991,"Aubrey! What happened?
Sweetheart, what happened?"
413,2830093,2831287,"Honey, what happened?
Who did this to you?"
414,2831395,2833761,"- Somebody come in here!
- Get off of me!"
415,2833864,2836230,"It's okay, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.
It's okay. It's Daddy."
416,2836333,2838858,It's all right.
417,2838969,2841437,"- Calm down and back away, Mr. Fleming.
- Don't you fucking touch me!"
418,2841538,2844996,"Somebody came in here and sliced up
my little girl. I want you to find him now!"
419,2846310,2848471,No! No!
420,2874137,2875900,I am Aubrey Fleming.
421,2878575,2880270,My name is Aubrey Fleming.
422,2880377,2884177,"I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach,
and playing the piano."
423,2884281,2887182,"I have never seen the inside of a strip club
or a crack house,"
424,2887284,2889809,"and I have never sold my body
to hairy old men with B.O."
425,2889920,2891717,Because I am perfect.
426,2898228,2901163,Say hello to your new state-of-the-art hand.
427,2908772,2911138,"Your nerve impulses get picked up
by sensors"
428,2911241,2914802,"that control six different sets of gears
and motors inside the hand,"
429,2914912,2918780,"so the movements are incredibly lifelike
and precise."
430,2918882,2920474,It's so creepy.
431,2920584,2922814,No. It's beautiful.
432,2922920,2925582,"Once we're sure everything works
the way it's supposed to,"
433,2925689,2927589,we'll fit this over it.
434,2934231,2935425,Lovely.
435,2936566,2938033,Step forward.
436,2942005,2943529,Take your time.
437,2947311,2948642,Beautiful.
438,2952749,2954512,"You're almost there, you're almost there."
439,2956987,2961549,"Excellent, excellent. You'll be back
on the dance floor in no time, Dakota."
440,2961658,2963125,It's amazing.
441,2963226,2965717,"- Thank you.
- For?"
442,2965862,2967727,For calling me Dakota.
443,2969700,2971964,"Just don't forget to plug it in
when you're not wearing it."
444,2972069,2975664,"If the battery runs down,
it's like dragging around a wooden leg."
445,2975772,2976864,Okay.
446,2991655,2994749,"I think we managed
to avoid all those reporters."
447,3047377,3049345,Aubrey chose the colors?
448,3052416,3055442,Yeah. Aubrey. Aubrey chose everything.
449,3074137,3076731,"Thanks for putting me up for a while.
I appreciate it."
450,3081445,3082639,Well...
451,3083647,3085911,"Looks like we're not the only ones
happy to see you home."
452,3089653,3091314,I don't like cats.
453,3093123,3094488,Okay. Yeah.
454,3096093,3097856,"If you need anything, just..."
455,3106536,3107764,Hold it!
456,3110507,3112475,"- ID, please.
- Yeah, sure."
457,3116847,3118007,Go on.
458,3121251,3123048,That's the boyfriend.
459,3153617,3154948,"- Hey.
- Hi."
460,3155051,3156450,Dakota Moss.
461,3157721,3159621,Jerrod. Jerrod Pointer.
462,3162359,3165351,"Sorry, I'm not really used to this thing yet."
463,3166830,3168923,"It's fucked up though, huh?"
464,3170834,3173268,"- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, sure."
465,3174371,3176100,Are those flowers for me?
466,3176206,3177298,Yeah.
467,3178475,3179669,Thanks.
468,3181945,3183344,Might as well sit down.
469,3191254,3192221,It's upstairs.
470,3194658,3196956,Just keep forgetting to plug it in at night.
471,3198895,3200795,I was supposed to protect you.
472,3200897,3202797,"So, you must be Aubrey's boyfriend."
473,3204067,3205159,Yeah.
474,3207170,3208296,I'm not Aubrey.
475,3212709,3214574,I'm really not Aubrey.
476,3226022,3227853,"Aubrey wouldn't do that, would she?"
477,3236466,3238366,Can I get you guys anything?
478,3241037,3242834,"Oh, hi, Mrs. Fleming."
479,3245542,3247009,We're gonna go upstairs.
480,3250347,3252008,"- Could you? Thanks.
- Sure."
481,3262125,3265094,"- Well, you coming?
- Yeah."
482,3269299,3272962,"Oh, and Susan, would you mind putting
the blue roses in some water for me?"
483,3273069,3274263,Thanks.
484,3288685,3292121,"There's only one of these,
so we better make it last."
485,3398428,3400191,"Don't stop! Oh, my God."
486,3424988,3425977,Aubrey?
487,3427023,3428320,Why are you doing this?
488,3431694,3433355,Did she ever fuck you like that?
489,3436800,3438529,Did she ever fuck you at all?
490,3442472,3443996,Do you think she'd start now?
491,3445809,3449040,"Look, if you want me to call you Dakota,
I'll call you Dakota."
492,3450146,3452808,"But if you're not Aubrey,
then how'd you get all cut up?"
493,3457420,3458887,I don't know.
494,3461357,3463257,I can't really explain.
495,3622185,3623379,"Oh, God."
496,3646009,3648671,I found that heroin ho just like that.
497,3649812,3651939,What happened to her hand?
498,3652048,3654949,"Why the hell you asking me?
How should I know?"
499,3655685,3658119,"What happened to your hand, kiddo?"
500,3660890,3662517,I'll be okay.
501,3662625,3664752,What happened to your hand?
502,3664861,3666726,"Damn, that bitch lost a lot of blood."
503,3666829,3669662,You can die from losing that kind of blood.
504,3670500,3671990,Dance.
505,3672101,3673295,I'm just saying!
506,3674270,3675430,Dance.
507,3676272,3680208,"Marlene is out there, and she'll kick my ass
if I go out there while she's on."
508,3680343,3681970,You go out there.
509,3695591,3696615,So?
510,3702131,3703689,I was just having a drink out back
511,3703800,3708066,"and I dropped a glass.
Must've cut myself when I picked it up."
512,3710506,3712974,How you gonna get to the emergency room?
513,3713076,3716341,Hospitals are for rich people. I'll be okay.
514,3716446,3717811,How you gonna get home?
515,3718715,3720239,I will be fine.
516,3721017,3723315,You better take an extra towel.
517,3734997,3736965,You got to hold it higher.
518,3740203,3742398,You got to hold it higher than your heart.
519,3757687,3760315,Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?
520,3764393,3765917,People get cut.
521,3767263,3768662,That's life.
522,3776506,3778701,People get cut. That's life.
523,3781244,3782404,Jesus.
524,3783212,3784679,"So my finger got cut off,"
525,3785648,3787172,but nobody did it.
526,3788317,3790308,Who's gonna believe that?
527,3792088,3794386,Look at you. You don't even believe it.
528,3794490,3795582,"Yeah, I do."
529,3796759,3798192,That's because I fucked you.
530,3802665,3804633,"- What is it?
- My foot."
531,3808738,3809705,Wrong foot.
532,3811073,3813234,It's phantom limb pain.
533,3815611,3818444,"It's enough to make you
believe in ghosts, huh?"
534,3819982,3822075,"You know,
maybe that's why ghosts are restless."
535,3825121,3828318,"Because there's nothing left
of what they were except for the pain."
536,3832762,3834161,"I need your help, Jerrod."
537,3855952,3857283,Piece of shit.
538,3858354,3861289,"Hey. You got a condom, man?"
539,3861390,3863187,"- No!
- What? I'm serious. I'll buy it off you."
540,3863292,3865055,"I'm sorry, kid. I don't have one."
541,3866362,3868796,"Hey, any of you guys got a rubber?"
542,3870600,3872534,"No, I'm... You don't carry rubbers?"
543,3873936,3875130,Thanks.
544,3882812,3884245,"Hey, hey!"
545,3887416,3888610,"Where you headed, boy?"
546,3889252,3891277,"Just let me through, okay?"
547,3892688,3894713,"- Go ahead, kid.
- Thank you."
548,3904634,3907125,We're at the Tolands' house. Here.
549,3910506,3912940,"- Not so hard.
- Sorry."
550,3913042,3914873,"So, this is it?"
551,3914977,3918105,"- You want me to go in with you?
- No, it's okay."
552,3918214,3920910,"You probably better go back.
They might get suspicious."
553,3932061,3933585,"- Okay.
- All right."
554,3933696,3934754,Bye.
555,3979141,3981234,"Why did you have to come here, Aubrey?"
556,3983546,3986481,"You've still got your life.
Nobody in this house has any left."
557,3987616,3989811,And you're not cooperating with the police.
558,3990086,3993283,"I've heard all about it.
You know, you could help find the monster."
559,3995057,3996786,"I'm sorry, I can't."
560,4006068,4009003,"I know you didn't come over here
to upset us."
561,4014043,4016011,Just seeing her room would be enough.
562,4100129,4101323,Aubrey!
563,4106435,4108232,This is what they call protecting us?
564,4108337,4109668,"- Where the hell was Lanny Rierden?
- All right."
565,4109772,4112002,"Daniel, come on. Just calm down.
She's safe."
566,4112108,4114076,"I mean, he's mad because he knows
I'm telling the truth."
567,4114176,4118738,"- He knows Aubrey's still out there.
- Aubrey, please. Just shut the fuck up."
568,4121183,4123208,Latest DNA test came back.
569,4125321,4128085,"Hello? Julie?
You want to take a look at them?"
570,4128190,4130215,Take a look at this.
571,4130326,4133625,"I thought I should go over
Aubrey's hard drive one more time, right?"
572,4135498,4138899,""" She wrote down the name
and her real mother's last known address,"
573,4139001,4143631,"""but it was what she saw next that
slammed her in the gut like a celestial fist."
574,4143739,4147675,"""She stared at the hospital records
in disbelief. It couldn't be true."
575,4147776,4150267,"""But there it was, in black and white."
576,4150379,4153143,"""Not only did she have a mother
she'd never met,"
577,4153249,4155581,"""she also had an identical twin."
578,4156852,4161755,"""But Virginia Sue Moss had left town
with her twin sister almost 20 years ago."
579,4161857,4164587,"""How would she ever find her other half?"
580,4164693,4167856,"""She knew only that she had to try.
She had no choice."
581,4169165,4170792,"""To be continued."""
582,4172635,4173897,Moss.
583,4174003,4175994,As in Dakota Moss. Yeah.
584,4177740,4179765,"- So this proves that...
- That she's always been"
585,4179875,4181342,and always will be Aubrey Fleming.
586,4181443,4184037,"I mean, she's living inside a world
she made up."
587,4185147,4188412,"So the DNA test comparing
Aubrey and Dakota..."
588,4188517,4189643,Came back identical.
589,4190419,4192148,"Damn right, it did."
590,4207036,4208936,Higher than your heart.
591,4220749,4222580,"Odd, even."
592,4223686,4226280,"Right, left."
593,4226388,4228982,"Rest, motion."
594,4229091,4230752,"Peace, war."
595,4232294,4234888,"Love, hate."
596,4234997,4236965,Two halves to everything.
597,4238567,4240558,Sometimes people get cut.
598,4244206,4246606,Sometimes people get cut in half.
599,4353916,4358148,"Darker than the shadowy depths
of the deepest ocean,"
600,4358253,4362952,"more infinite than the starry universe,
in three meager pounds,"
601,4363058,4367119,"all the knowledge that ever was
or ever will be."
602,4367229,4372292,"I'm Art Bell,
and these are the mysteries of the mind."
603,4372401,4374733,"The best documented case
of stigmatic twins"
604,4375537,4379667,"is that of Joseph K., 35,
and his twin brother, Jacob."
605,4381176,4385442,"Jacob K. Was a petty thief
with a gambling problem."
606,4385547,4389347,"He owed more than $5,000 to the mob."
607,4389451,4393080,"Unable to pay off his loan,
Jacob K. Was targeted for assassination"
608,4393188,4396521,"on the night of December 18th, 1944."
609,4399762,4402560,"The very same night Jacob K.
Was gunned down,"
610,4402664,4407601,"a deep puncture wound appeared
in Joseph K. 's neck in the same spot."
611,4407703,4410695,"Lacking all explanation,
authorities concluded"
612,4410806,4413900,that Joseph K. 's wound was self-inflicted.
613,4414009,4417172,"They failed, however,
to address just how he could've known"
614,4417279,4420339,"the precise location
of his brother's mortal wound"
615,4421316,4426185,"or how both men happened to die
at the same hour, miles apart."
616,4430759,4431783,Hey.
617,4431894,4434294,I saw the light. You all right?
618,4435364,4437229,Yeah. I couldn't sleep.
619,4440169,4443002,"This is a non-smoking house, young lady."
620,4449812,4451575,And will remain one.
621,4453982,4457679,"You know, I think that's the first time
I've seen you..."
622,4464927,4467919,"- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I shouldn't have."
623,4469331,4471162,I think I'm Aubrey's twin sister.
624,4472801,4474393,Her identical twin sister.
625,4474503,4476937,"I mean, hospitals make mistakes.
We could've been separated at birth."
626,4478607,4481075,"Look at this house,
this life that your daughter had."
627,4481176,4484270,"Why would I pretend to be some loser
if this was all mine, huh?"
628,4485414,4487245,"It's like a bad dream, sweetie."
629,4488417,4493047,"And someday very soon,
you're gonna wake up and realize the truth."
630,4493155,4495385,"But it's possible we could be twins, right?"
631,4497860,4499088,You see?
632,4502030,4504464,You were all by yourself in there.
633,4506735,4509533,No twin sister. Just you.
634,4515310,4517938,"I'm not much of a crier, you know,"
635,4519648,4521775,but I cried when I saw this.
636,4524086,4525678,Daniel and I...
637,4528156,4529350,I fell.
638,4531026,4532186,And
639,4533795,4537959,"they made me stay in my bed,
flat on my back, for about six weeks."
640,4540035,4542128,"Six weeks towards the end,
but it was worth it."
641,4542237,4544899,"I mean, there were times when I thought,"
642,4545007,4547737,"""I'm not gonna be able
to stand another moment of this."""
643,4548577,4552240,"But there were also...
There were times when you'd get"
644,4552347,4554838,real still on me.
645,4556218,4560245,"And I'd take both my hands,
I'd put them on my belly, and I said,"
646,4560355,4564086,"""Kick. Kick the hell out of me, girl.
Show me what you got."""
647,4564192,4567252,And you'd kick. Every time.
648,4569398,4571423,"The night you were born. Oh, my God."
649,4572668,4573828,It was terrifying.
650,4575370,4579033,"I barely saw you,
and they took you away from me."
651,4579141,4582508,"And it was...
It was touch-and-go for two whole days."
652,4582611,4587139,"And then finally,
finally I had you in my arms."
653,4589184,4590811,A little miracle.
654,4593322,4597156,"I'm not trying to prove you wrong,
you know?"
655,4598560,4601256,I'm really just trying to help you see.
656,4609171,4610365,I know.
657,4614242,4616233,But you don't believe me.
658,4622384,4625148,"But you don't need me
to believe you, sweetheart."
659,4626321,4629222,When I think we'll never be normal again...
660,4633695,4634662,I...
661,4635897,4639094,I see that about you. That strength.
662,4642938,4647932,"And I think, you know, we'll be all right.
No matter what."
663,4648043,4650375,"Different, maybe, but all right."
664,4651847,4653474,"'Cause you're a kicker, girl."
665,4655384,4656817,You go right ahead
666,4656918,4660752,"and you kick your way
to the other side of this problem."
667,4661990,4666290,"I'm gonna be there every step of the way
if you need me."
668,4710906,4711998,Shit.
669,4716812,4718302,Dakota.
670,4810405,4812134,"I know what you did, Daniel."
671,4812941,4815239,"- Susan's baby died in the incubator.
- She what?"
672,4815343,4817106,"You bought Aubrey
from the crack head down the hall"
673,4817212,4818236,because she had one to spare.
674,4818346,4819313,"- You're Aubrey.
- Not me."
675,4819414,4820381,"- Hey, you're Aubrey.
- Not me, Daniel."
676,4820515,4821504,"- You were kidnapped...
- I'm not Aubrey."
677,4821616,4824210,"...and you were hurt, and you're home now.
- Daniel, I'm not Aubrey."
678,4824319,4825786,I'm her twin. Stop it!
679,4827322,4828914,I'm her twin.
680,4829024,4831891,"Daniel, you're the only one who knows
that there are really two of us."
681,4831993,4834359,"- You have to help me.
- I'm trying to help you, honey. I am."
682,4834462,4836089,"No, I saw the envelopes."
683,4837232,4838824,I saw the New Salem postmarks.
684,4840135,4841932,A little cash on an ongoing basis.
685,4842037,4844096,"One hits the jackpot,
the other one gets stuck"
686,4844206,4847573,"- with Virginia Sue Moss.
- Okay, enough, okay? Just..."
687,4848810,4851404,"I'm tired of this shit, okay? Just..."
688,4855550,4857950,I'm gonna get you some ice.
689,4858053,4860578,"So you'd let both of us die
just to keep your secret?"
690,4860689,4861713,No!
691,4867596,4870463,She lost this one first. So did I.
692,4873235,4874327,Fuck.
693,4919214,4920272,Fuck!
694,4959054,4960248,"Oh, my..."
695,4971900,4973265,"Oh, my God."
696,4979841,4982332,I always felt like half a person.
697,4982444,4984241,"You know, half a person with half a soul."
698,4985313,4988077,"It never occurred to me
that I may possibly have a twin."
699,4988984,4992818,"All I had to go on was a gut feeling
and a New Salem postmark."
700,5006401,5009461,"Look, Daniel, I know you may not care
about what happened to me."
701,5010438,5012429,But what about Aubrey?
702,5012540,5014838,"What about the girl you raised
to be your daughter?"
703,5014943,5017639,"Everything that happens to Aubrey
happens to me."
704,5018646,5022047,"He still has her, okay?"
705,5022417,5024317,"Now, are you gonna help me find her?"
706,5026821,5028152,"- I can't.
- You can't?"
707,5028256,5031157,"- I can't risk losing this.
- You're pathetic."
708,5033361,5034988,Go fuck yourself.
709,5179774,5181833,"""Blue ribbons are for winners."
710,5183144,5185305,"""Never settle for the red."
711,5186848,5189214,"""Rest in peace. Douglas."""
712,5202564,5205089,"- It's okay, it's me.
- I know who killed me."
713,5205200,5206758,"You're alive, Dakota, okay? You're not..."
714,5206868,5208130,"No, look."
715,5217545,5219570,"We really shouldn't go up there
without letting somebody know."
716,5219681,5223117,"- We don't have enough time.
- I know, I know, I know."
717,5223218,5227450,"Dakota, there's not enough air."
718,5227555,5229648,"- What is it?
- I can't..."
719,5229757,5231019,"- Hold on. Just breathe.
- No, I can't breathe."
720,5231125,5232092,"- Breathe. You're having a panic...
- I can't."
721,5232193,5233990,"- You're having a panic attack. Just breathe.
- I can't breathe."
722,5234095,5235221,"It's okay. Come on, breathe."
723,5235330,5237798,It's okay. It's okay.
724,5237899,5240959,"You need to breathe. Good, good. Breathe."
725,5253648,5256378,I should've believed you from the start.
726,5257919,5259250,I'm sorry.
727,5323718,5325413,Dakota.
728,5332193,5335162,Douglas Norquist.
729,5338599,5341159,There's two halves to everything.
730,5361189,5366855,"Oh, come on. Just breathe, Aubrey.
Breathe. Slowly."
731,5541269,5542531,Fuck you!
732,5650344,5651709,"Oh, my God."
733,5655483,5657747,"Daniel, come on. Wake up."
734,5657852,5659547,Come on.
735,5659654,5660848,Aubrey?
736,5666527,5667619,Yeah.
737,5670264,5673756,"- I'm sorry.
