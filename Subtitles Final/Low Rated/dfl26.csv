1,27087,29173,The world we live in.
2,30299,33469,"It's so wondrous, mysterious,"
3,33594,36097,even magical.
4,36222,39141,"No. No, not that world."
5,39266,42060,I meant this one.
6,42186,43938,The smartphone.
7,44063,46482,"Each system and
program and app"
8,46608,49235,"is its own little planet
of perfect technology,"
9,49360,51905,"all providing
services so necessary,"
10,52030,54866,"so crucial,
so unbelievably profound."
11,55033,57202,"Look who
just sent me a text."
12,57327,58578,Addie McAllister?
13,58703,61040,"Must be a mistake.
Or a joke. Or a scam."
14,61206,62582,"Don't send her your
Social Security number."
15,62707,64377,Dude.
16,64544,65670,She's right there.
17,65795,68213,"That's our user, Alex."
18,68339,70049,"And, like every
freshman in high school,"
19,70174,73803,"his whole life, everything,
revolves around his phone."
20,79392,82854,"And, as the pace of life
gets faster and faster..."
21,82979,84564,Phones down in five.
22,84730,86942,"And attention spans
get shorter and shorter and..."
23,87067,89069,"You're probably not even
listening to me right now."
24,89236,92739,"Who has the time to
type out actual words?"
25,92906,94908,"And that's where we come in,"
26,95075,97661,"the most important invention in
the history of communication..."
27,101040,103375,Emojis.
28,103500,105211,That's my home.
29,105336,106713,Textopolis.
30,109340,111300,"Here, each of us
does one thing,"
31,111426,114346,"and we have to
nail it every time."
32,114471,116180,The Christmas Tree just has to
33,116305,117807,stand there all festive.
34,117932,119141,Merry Christmas.
35,119267,120978,"It's still
September, Tim."
36,121103,122187,The Princesses...
37,122229,123271,I am so pretty.
38,123438,125565,"They just got to wear their crowns
and keep their hair combed."
39,125690,127109,"You guys, we are so pretty."
40,129569,131279,"Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up."
41,131447,132531,"They just show up,
and they're good to go."
42,134157,136660,"But for the faces,
the pressure is on."
43,136785,139622,"Crier always has to cry, even
if he's just won the lottery."
44,139788,142416,Hooray! I'm a billionaire!
45,142541,144210,"The Laugher
is always laughing,"
46,144335,146462,"even if he's
just broken his arm."
47,146587,149173,I can see the bone!
48,150299,152594,"Now, me, I'm a Meh."
49,152719,154638,"So I got to be totally
over it all the time,"
50,154804,156640,"you know, like,
""Meh, who cares?"""
51,156765,158517,"Which is not as
easy as it sounds."
52,172156,175826,"Morning, Mrs. D. I see you have
the little minis with you."
53,175951,178121,They're so cute.
54,187964,189674,"That is so adorable,
I can't take it!"
55,192969,195013,"Now I'll never
get them to sleep."
56,195139,196682,"Stick to your
one face, weirdo."
57,198517,199851,No! No!
58,200018,202604,"It's hard to
always act blase,"
59,202729,205775,"when living in Textopolis
is just so exciting."
60,205900,207318,"Hello, good simians."
61,207443,209946,"Those are some
sharp attaches."
62,210071,212113,"Yes, well, we have
business to attend to."
63,212239,214575,What kind of business?
64,214576,214616,Monkey business.
65,216244,217870,I sounded British!
66,219664,221583,"Meh. That
was really good."
67,221708,225086,"Meh. Meh.
That was a great..."
68,225211,226880,"-Whatcha doing there, mate?
-Practicing."
69,227005,228840,"Today is my first
day on the phone."
70,228965,231551,"Boy.
I'm gonna be so meh."
71,231676,233553,What are you gonna do?
72,233678,235931,"Me and the boys are gonna throw
ourselves on the barbie!"
73,236056,237558,Here's my sauce now.
74,238851,240018,"G'day, mate."
75,242855,244773,"Hey.
Konnichiwa."
76,244899,247568,"Sorry, emoticons!"
77,247693,248778,"I hate knocking
over the elderly."
78,248903,250070,"Here, let me help,
let me help."
79,250238,252073,My colon!
80,254450,256077,Is that the time?
81,256244,257911,"Hey, my eyes
are up here, pal."
82,261082,262584,Yeah! All right!
83,271260,272720,Right on time.
84,276557,278058,"So, last week,"
85,278183,279769,"Alex sends me
next to this guy."
86,282104,284274,"That kid! Where does
he get this stuff?"
87,288986,291281,"Why are you
laughing, freak?"
88,294242,297954,"Now, unlike me,
my parents are total pros."
89,298079,300874,"Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now."
90,300999,302333,In public.
91,303626,305962,"He was.
I remember."
92,306087,308132,"Let's go somewhere
more private."
93,311134,313387,"I have some bad news, Gene."
94,313512,315598,"And I'm afraid you'll
have the wrong reaction."
95,315723,318434,"Okay. What's the
wrong reaction?"
96,318560,320937,"Anything other than ""meh."""
97,322439,323731,"Come on. I don't
want to be late."
98,323856,325524,"I'm not letting you
go to work today."
99,325650,326693,"Wait, what?"
100,326818,328820,"You're just not ready, son."
101,328945,331614,"Come on! Working in the cube is
an emoji's whole purpose in life."
102,331739,334201,"Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me."
103,334326,337120,"Sweetie,
that's not true."
104,339456,341624,"Yeah! I'm gonna work on the
phone, and I'm only 10."
105,341750,344503,"That's because
I believe in you."
106,344628,346213,Should we wash our hands?
107,349007,350676,"No, no, no."
108,350844,352678,We're number two!
109,352803,354638,"We're number two!
We're number two!"
110,355389,356682,See?
111,359018,361145,"I... I know
I'm different, okay?"
112,361270,364023,"But when I need to,
I can be meh."
113,364858,366484,I just...
114,366610,368862,"I want to be a working
emoji, you know, like..."
115,368987,370864,"Like everybody else,
and then..."
116,371030,373242,"Then I would finally
fit in, you know?"
117,373367,375202,"You fit in, honey."
118,375369,377246,"No, I don't, Mom."
119,377371,379456,I never have.
120,379581,381833,"But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance."
121,381958,385545,"But what if you get sent out on
the phone, making the wrong face?"
122,385671,387548,"No, Dad, I'll make
the right face."
123,387715,389091,Look.
124,389217,391135,Meh...
125,391260,393679,"You're so handsome
when you make that face."
126,393804,395348,"I think he's ready, Mel."
127,396224,397517,Meh.
128,399560,400896,"Come on, Dad."
129,401021,403440,Let me prove it to you.
130,403565,405275,"If you really
think you're ready."
131,405400,409070,"I am! Yes! Yes. I promise,
I won't let you down."
132,410155,411282,Stop.
133,423210,425755,"Congratulations, everyone!"
134,425880,428925,"What an exciting
day for all of you."
135,429050,430259,It's really her.
136,430384,432054,Pizza!
137,433305,434556,Hey!
138,434681,436933,Your first day on the job.
139,437099,438644,Hi. Hi.
140,438769,442230,"Don't be nervous. I won't bite.
Hi. I'm Smiler."
141,442355,443481,Don't touch me.
142,443606,444149,Hi!
143,444191,444691,Okay.
144,444816,446276,"I mean, hey."
145,446444,449697,"As you know, I'm Smiler."
146,449822,452115,"I am the system
supervisor here"
147,452240,454618,"because I was
the original emoji."
148,459582,460959,Here's how it works.
149,461125,462335,It's nothing fancy.
150,462460,464879,"Wait a minute.
It's really fancy!"
151,470301,473679,"You each have your own
cube on the emoji bar."
152,473805,475640,"If Alex chooses you,"
153,475807,478935,"should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up."
154,480645,483315,It's showtime.
155,483482,485359,"The scanner will scan you,"
156,487236,492242,"and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box."
157,492367,494159,"And let me tell you,
guys,"
158,494284,499082,"there is nothing like getting
scanned for the first time."
159,499207,502377,You're gonna love it. Really.
160,502502,505588,"Now, over here is
the favorites section"
161,505714,509885,"where you'll find all
the most popular emojis."
162,510010,513180,"And, of course,
you'll find my cube here."
163,515640,516850,You are smooth.
164,517018,518352,Just doing my duty.
165,518477,520938,What? What did I say?
166,521063,524650,Rocket looking to party.
167,524775,527319,"Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted."
168,527445,528946,"Steven, for the last time,"
169,529071,530698,"I don't want to
buy a time-share."
170,530865,534161,"Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite."
171,534286,535870,"Alex hasn't
picked you in weeks."
172,536037,538040,"And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite."
173,538165,540041,"It's got to be
some sort of mistake."
174,540207,543044,"I mean, look at me, I'm an
attractive hand giving a high five."
175,543170,545672,Fist Bump. Come on in.
176,545673,545713,Hey.
177,545798,549176,"Fist Bump? He's a
knucklehead. Literally."
178,549301,551261,"Look at him.
I can look like that."
179,552721,553889,"Cramp.
Huge mistake."
180,555724,558560,"Help. Help me.
Help up the hand."
181,558686,559978,There you go.
182,560020,561313,"Thanks, mate."
183,561439,564400,"Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,"
184,564567,566277,"and then I'll just
slip under the rope?"
185,566402,569071,Is someone lost?
186,569237,570740,"Smiler, hi. Just leaving."
187,570907,573076,"Yeah, you know,
just killing time"
188,573243,575703,"before I go back to my
cube in the far corner"
189,575829,578665,"where Alex can't
even see me anymore!"
190,578790,580625,"You may not be
a favorite anymore,"
191,580750,583754,"but you will always
have a place in the cube."
192,583921,585505,"Yeah, in the nosebleeds."
193,585630,588800,"I'm standing
right here. Words hurt."
194,588926,593097,"The most important thing I can
tell you is to just be yourself."
195,593222,595099,Blah.
196,595265,598561,"I was made to be happy,
so I am always smiling."
197,598686,602232,"Places, please.
Emojis to your cubes."
198,602357,605235,Attention. We've got incoming.
199,605360,606944,"Got to be meh.
Got to be meh."
200,608321,610073,"My gosh, my own cube."
201,610198,612909,"I can't believe it.
I could put a plant over here."
202,613034,615704,"And over here could go
an inspirational calendar."
203,615829,618414,"Okay. Got to be meh.
Got to be meh."
204,618539,620584,"Look at
our son down there."
205,620709,623045,I'm just beaming
206,624170,626966,with pride.
207,627133,629636,"You don't think he'll
actually get picked, do you?"
208,632179,634515,Hie-ro-gly-phics.
209,634640,637894,"Hieroglyphics was an ancient
language of picture forms."
210,638019,640730,"Does that remind
anyone of anything?"
211,640855,645235,"Hello? A language
of pictures. Anyone?"
212,645360,650533,"Early hieroglyphs
date back as far as 3,300..."
213,650658,652659,"I got to
reply to Addie's text."
214,652825,654745,What should I write?
215,654746,654787,Nothing.
216,654870,656621,Words aren't cool.
217,658332,660918,Okay. Be cool. Be cool.
218,662878,665381,"All right, Alex is not sure
how he wants to play this."
219,665506,668133,"I would really
love it to be me."
220,668259,670178,Beam me up! Beam me up!
221,670303,671805,I need Thumbs Up on standby.
222,671930,674473,"Yeah!
Thumbs Up is going in!"
223,676309,678269,"Wait!
Alex is changing his mind."
224,680479,681856,He's moving.
225,686236,687987,"Okay. Looks like
it's gonna be Meh."
226,691200,694036,"I'm so nervous,
I could almost shrug."
227,695579,696872,We are go for Meh.
228,697039,698707,Initiating scan.
229,698833,702044,Okay. You can do this.
230,702169,704547,"I can't do this!
I can't do it!"
231,704548,704589,What is this?
232,705548,707007,Stop the scan!
233,707133,709969,I can't! It's too late!
234,710094,713556,"Meh, meh, meh, meh. My
goodness, I'm freaking out!"
235,713681,714766,What's he doing?
236,714891,716142,He's making the wrong face!
237,716267,718979,"Good for him!
Little... Wait, what?"
238,719104,721232,Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!
239,721398,722566,Abort! Abort!
240,723900,725402,"Shut it down!
Shut it down!"
241,733619,735245,What is that emoji?
242,735371,738082,"Wrong emoji sent!
Evacuate the Meh cube!"
243,740960,742211,Evacuate the cube!
244,742336,743755,I got to get out of here.
245,747509,748760,Get that bozo out of there!
246,748885,750262,I'm trying!
247,762232,765611,No!
248,766528,767613,My God.
249,775121,777164,The humanity.
250,777289,779542,Medic.
251,781420,784756,"Sorry, everybody. That was
not what I meant to do."
252,784881,786299,I kinda...
253,786466,787550,I kinda panicked.
254,787675,789761,"Are you even
a Meh at all?"
255,789886,791847,Course he is.
256,791972,793640,He's my spitting image.
257,793765,796393,"If you have expressions
other than meh,"
258,796518,799146,"what you are
is a malfunction."
259,804026,806196,Malfunction?
260,806321,809657,"No! I can be meh. Just
give me one more chance."
261,809824,812492,That's not gonna happen.
262,812660,814662,"You know what
would be really fun?"
263,814787,816413,A board meeting.
264,816539,818499,"Where we could figure out
what to do with you!"
265,823839,825006,"I knew there was
something wrong with him."
266,825173,827134,A malfunction?
267,827259,827884,What's gonna happen to him?
268,827926,828510,"He can't
work on the phone."
269,828677,830511,What would Alex think?
270,830636,831972,What do his parents think?
271,847529,851492,"I just wanted to be useful, you know?
Fit in."
272,851617,854328,"Now everybody
thinks I'm a malfunction."
273,858332,861586,I am a malfunction.
274,861711,864214,"Even if you are
a malfunction, Gene,"
275,864339,867175,"your mom and dad
still love ya."
276,867300,868927,I knew you weren't ready.
277,869052,871639,"Let's get you out of
here and take you home."
278,871764,874057,"One day, all this
will blow over,"
279,874225,877728,"and everyone will almost
forget about what you did."
280,878562,879980,"Until then,"
281,880106,882858,"you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment."
282,882983,885236,"Wait. You want
to hide me away?"
283,886237,887864,You're embarrassed of me.
284,887989,889532,It's for your own safety.
285,889657,891743,"We're trying to
protect you, son."
286,894078,896498,Gene? Where are you going?
287,896623,898458,"I'm not gonna
run away from this."
288,898583,901629,"I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,"
289,903130,905758,"I've got to have some
sort of purpose here."
290,905925,906967,I know it.
291,907092,909136,"Gene, no."
292,909261,911263,"Sweetie, please."
293,917061,918520,Boy.
294,918646,919397,A malfunction...
295,919439,920106,Order! Order!
296,920273,922149,The motion is carried.
297,923443,925861,"So, how'd it go, Gavel?"
298,925986,928698,"Hey, Light Bulb, tell me
what's going on in there."
299,928823,931576,"What?
Poop, what is it?"
300,931702,933745,"Tell me, turd. Tell me true.
What happened?"
301,933870,937624,"I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents."
302,937791,939292,"You're so soft, Poop."
303,939417,941878,"Not too soft, I hope."
304,942003,943296,Gene!
305,943421,945674,"We were just gonna
come looking for you."
306,945799,948177,"Why don't you come
inside the boardroom,"
307,948302,950721,"and we can have
a teeny, weeny chat."
308,960565,964444,"Um, I came up here to defend
myself, but you seem pretty happy."
309,965362,967322,"So, good news?"
310,967489,970658,"Right.
I'm always happy."
311,970783,972995,"Right.
Hashtag truth."
312,973120,976123,"Well, the only thing that
could ever make me unhappy"
313,976249,979710,"is if one of our
emoji team made a mistake,"
314,979835,983589,"which caused Alex to
lose faith in the phone."
315,985341,988761,"And then our whole
world gets wiped out."
316,990346,993725,"Smiler, I double-pinky-swear
promise to you"
317,993850,997687,"that I will never, ever make
a mistake in the cube again."
318,997812,1000106,"We know you
won't, Gene."
319,1000232,1002442,We know you won't.
320,1002567,1004528,"You know,
the first time you said it,"
321,1004653,1007657,"it sounded genuine,
but then you repeated it,"
322,1007782,1009199,"and then, that was weird."
323,1009324,1011035,"That's because
we're setting you up"
324,1011201,1013703,"with our best
Anti-Virus Bots."
325,1016498,1019794,"So, they'll like... They'll just...
They're gonna fix me?"
326,1019919,1022797,"Actually, delete you.
But yes!"
327,1022922,1024925,"If you get deleted,"
328,1025050,1027593,"you don't
have to worry about"
329,1027718,1030971,"what your purpose
is or the future"
330,1031097,1034059,"or why you're
such a malfunction."
331,1034225,1035894,"'Cause you're deleted, right?"
332,1036061,1037395,"All right, good talk."
333,1037562,1039065,Bots!
334,1043027,1044236,No!
335,1047781,1049240,Don't let him escape!
336,1064341,1066383,"Party time!
Wait a minute..."
337,1082485,1084737,The air is better here.
338,1087948,1089033,"Beer, Tea."
339,1089075,1090118,I'm Coffee!
340,1090243,1092746,Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.
341,1099211,1101295,My old cube.
342,1101420,1104340,"Take a hike, Mike."
343,1104466,1107177,"-My name's not Mike.
-What?"
344,1107302,1109262,There's AV Bots coming!
345,1109263,1109303,For me?
346,1109387,1111223,"Just because I'm in
the wrong section?"
347,1114018,1115977,Holy deleto!
348,1121901,1123027,What do we do?
349,1123068,1124154,Quick! This way!
350,1129325,1130576,Let's go.
351,1137833,1140003,"Don't tell anyone
you're about to see this."
352,1141462,1143339,"They'll never
find us down here."
353,1143464,1146134,"Where are we?
The basement?"
354,1146260,1149388,"No. Welcome to
the Loser Lounge,"
355,1149513,1153017,"where the emojis
who never get used hang out."
356,1155101,1157604,"Go fish, Fish Cake
With Swirl."
357,1160149,1163194,"Sweep so you won't cry.
Sweep so you won't cry."
358,1163320,1165487,Sweep so you won't cry.
359,1167990,1170535,I almost got deleted.
360,1170660,1172369,"Me, Hi-5."
361,1172495,1174456,"Hey. What's up, Hi-5?"
362,1174581,1177626,"They weren't trying to delete you.
They were trying to delete me."
363,1177751,1179502,"You? What's so
important about you"
364,1179627,1181547,"they'd send out
an entire team of Bots?"
365,1181672,1183673,They say I'm a malfunction.
366,1187052,1190513,"You bringing malfunctions
in here now, Hi-5?"
367,1190638,1192808,"For crying out loud,
Abandoned Luggage,"
368,1192933,1195561,"that had better not be
my leftover Chinese food."
369,1197062,1198231,What Chinese food?
370,1202026,1203820,"Do you have any
idea what it's like"
371,1203945,1206030,"to be living large,
hashtag blessed,"
372,1206155,1211577,"the favorite of the favorites, and
then demoted to this pit of despair?"
373,1211745,1213622,"Here, will you hit
my calluses for me?"
374,1213747,1215624,"At least you're
a working emoji."
375,1215750,1217251,That's all I ever wanted.
376,1217376,1219419,"Well, if that's all it'll take"
377,1219587,1222923,"for you to be satisfied, then just
find a hacker and get reprogrammed."
378,1223048,1224383,It's not that complicated.
379,1224508,1225759,"Where would I find
a hacker?"
380,1225884,1227637,In the Piracy app. Duh.
381,1227762,1229889,"Who took my
clear nail polish?"
382,1231932,1233601,Piracy app?
383,1233768,1236604,"To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis."
384,1236771,1239607,"So? I've done it.
Would you be a brother?"
385,1239774,1242152,"One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether."
386,1242277,1243904,Now she lives on the cloud.
387,1244029,1246322,That is good.
388,1246447,1249450,"I'm sure the hacker that helped her
do that could easily reprogram you."
389,1249576,1251870,The name's Jailbreak.
390,1251871,1251912,Jailbreak?
391,1251995,1253955,"That's great!
Reprogrammed."
392,1254122,1255624,"I just need to
be reprogrammed,"
393,1255749,1259170,"and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be."
394,1259295,1261673,"Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?"
395,1261798,1263799,"Maybe this hacker
could help you, too."
396,1263924,1267469,"Like rewrite some code, get you
into the favorites section."
397,1267594,1269389,Wait a minute.
398,1269514,1271974,"I've been
trying to use my charisma"
399,1272099,1274310,"and sense of entitlement
to get me back on top,"
400,1274477,1275854,but all I need is a hacker.
401,1275979,1278981,"Today's your lucky day.
Let's roll."
402,1279148,1281068,"Hey, can I come, too?"
403,1281193,1282903,"Talk to the hand, Red Wagon."
404,1285113,1286907,I thought I was.
405,1287032,1289201,"Bye, Felicia."
406,1290744,1292370,"Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl."
407,1292495,1296834,"Daddy's heading back to the
VIPs where he belongs!"
408,1296960,1298627,Wait. What about the Bots?
409,1300170,1301505,Good point. Good point.
410,1317731,1319733,Ouch!
411,1319858,1321568,Hey.
412,1321694,1322987,"I shouldn't
have picked the cactus."
413,1323112,1324321,"I just...
I shouldn't have picked it."
414,1324446,1325364,"You didn't even
try to get the tree."
415,1325531,1327157,It's baffling. Let's go.
416,1333706,1334874,Hi-5?
417,1336209,1337377,Hello?
418,1339044,1340338,Hi-5?
419,1341964,1343049,Where are you?
420,1343174,1344800,I'm right here!
421,1344925,1346051,Gene!
422,1346176,1348013,"Here we are,
end of the text app."
423,1351850,1353560,No way.
424,1353727,1355854,"Come on, Gene.
It's perfectly safe."
425,1355979,1357773,"Gene, help me!"
426,1357898,1359483,"The wallpaper
monster's got me!"
427,1359484,1359525,"No! Hold on, hold on!"
428,1359608,1361402,Hi-5!
429,1361527,1364530,"No. This is all my fault!
I'm so sorry, Hi-5! I'm..."
430,1364655,1366448,I'm just messing with you.
431,1366573,1368367,"It's one of those
rubber finger-monster puppets"
432,1368492,1371120,"from the '80s.
I collected the whole set."
433,1371246,1372789,"All right, you coming?"
434,1372914,1373830,What do I do?
435,1373873,1374749,What do you mean?
436,1374874,1376584,"Just take a step
through the other side."
437,1380046,1381172,This is it.
438,1381297,1382924,"The next time
I come back here,"
439,1383925,1385636,I'll be a real Meh.
440,1389807,1390933,Hi-5?
441,1401109,1402485,No!
442,1407992,1409285,Are you finished?
443,1411871,1413457,Where are we?
444,1413582,1416584,Welcome to the Wallpaper.
445,1425135,1427888,This place is incredible.
446,1428013,1429598,"Each app is its
own unique world."
447,1431141,1433435,"That's my face.
You're on my... Thank you."
448,1437272,1438899,What is this place?
449,1439024,1440234,WeChat.
450,1445072,1447200,"It's like
a whole other world."
451,1447325,1448994,It is.
452,1454082,1456167,What are they?
453,1456335,1458253,"They're Bubble Pups. They might be
cute, but, man, are they clingy."
454,1458378,1459505,Whee!
455,1459630,1461673,"They're stickers, Gene."
456,1461840,1463967,Try to get with the program.
457,1464092,1465636,This is so cool.
458,1465761,1468514,Wait. What's in that one?
459,1468639,1470182,"-Guys, look at this picture.
-Look at my baby."
460,1470349,1471406,"This is what I ate
for breakfast."
461,1471407,1473278,"-This is what I ate for lunch!
-Here's me on a hike!"
462,1473279,1474817,"Here's me in the gym!
Here's me in the bathroom!"
463,1474818,1477064,"Everybody's
talking about themselves."
464,1477189,1478691,"How does he know
so many people?"
465,1478816,1481403,"None of these people know him,
but they like him,"
466,1481528,1484614,"and that's what matters
in this life, popularity."
467,1484739,1486115,I...
468,1486240,1487617,I think I'd...
469,1487743,1489786,"I think I'd rather
just have a real friend."
470,1489911,1492330,"A real friend? How's that
gonna get you anywhere?"
471,1492455,1494750,What you need are fans.
472,1494875,1498629,"They give you complete
and unrelenting support."
473,1498754,1500297,As long as you're on top.
474,1502007,1504718,"Poor Gene.
I blame myself."
475,1504843,1507220,"I blame you, too."
476,1507346,1509598,"I just wanted
to be supportive."
477,1509723,1512059,You just wanted a vacation.
478,1512184,1514853,"You take
that back, Mel Meh."
479,1518357,1520234,Bots.
480,1520359,1522778,"If they haven't found Gene by
now, he must have skipped town."
481,1522903,1524364,You mean the Wallpaper?
482,1524489,1526074,Our boy's on the run.
483,1526240,1528076,"How about we
find him ourselves?"
484,1528243,1529744,"Yeah, for sure."
485,1537294,1539588,"Tell all Bots to
follow those Mehs."
486,1539754,1540989,I'm sure they'll know all the
487,1540990,1543883,"freaky-deaky apps
Gene will hide out in."
488,1544009,1546053,"I'm really good at
making plans, you guys."
489,1546178,1548348,Right?
490,1548473,1550683,"Here we are.
The Piracy app."
491,1550808,1553228,"This is where
we'll find Jailbreak."
492,1553353,1555814,"Um... But this
is the Dictionary."
493,1555939,1558148,"That's just what Alex
wants his parents to think."
494,1558274,1559943,This is called a skin.
495,1560068,1561945,"Really? What could
a teenage boy"
496,1562070,1565532,"possibly want to
hide from his parents?"
497,1565657,1568284,"Just try to keep up. This
place can get a little rough."
498,1577336,1579212,"Ahoy, mateys."
499,1579338,1580965,Look who's back!
500,1581090,1582591,Hi-5!
501,1582716,1585011,"I'm a bit of a celebrity here.
Always welcome.!"
502,1585136,1586470,Loser!
503,1586638,1588097,Come on. Follow me.
504,1594687,1596564,Great. Emojis.
505,1596689,1600318,"I thought the conversation
just got dumber."
506,1600360,1601529,"Internet trolls.
Just ignore them."
507,1601654,1603488,"Eventually, they'll
get a job or a girlfriend"
508,1603655,1606366,"or some sort of purpose in
life, and they'll stop."
509,1609077,1611580,"Virus. We'll just... We'll
just walk over this way."
510,1616752,1618128,"Hi! It's so great
to see you again."
511,1618253,1620339,Do I know you?
512,1620506,1622926,"It's Spam. Just sign here and I can
get you special discounts on vitamins"
513,1623051,1624677,"and credit card offers
that can save you up to 25%."
514,1624843,1627471,"No, no, no,
don't get sucked in."
515,1627596,1628847,"Back off, Spam!"
516,1628974,1630600,"It's the only way to
deal... Back off!"
517,1630725,1632185,Thank you very much!
518,1632310,1635354,"You can illegally download
our CD right here."
519,1635522,1637691,"Hey, Trojan Horse.
How are you?"
520,1637857,1639358,"Yeah, what'll it be, hand?"
521,1639484,1642696,"I'll have a bottle of
""Hack Daniel's."""
522,1644699,1648243,"Maybe with a plate
of cheese and hackers?"
523,1648368,1650538,You trying to find a hacker?
524,1650705,1652039,"You can just ask, you know."
525,1652164,1653540,"Sorry. Um, yes."
526,1653666,1655793,"We're looking for
a hacker named Jailbreak."
527,1655918,1657378,"I know a guy that
can hook you up."
528,1660966,1662217,Right over there.
529,1663384,1664595,He looks capable.
530,1666221,1669182,"No, not him. Her."
531,1669307,1670892,Wait. He's a she?
532,1672936,1674354,"Hey, Jailbreak."
533,1674479,1676315,Mind if we join you?
534,1676316,1676357,Yes.
535,1676440,1678233,"That's the thing about
the Internet, isn't it?"
536,1678359,1680444,"You can never tell if someone's
being ironic or sincere."
537,1680569,1683405,"I sincerely, unironically
want you to go away."
538,1684865,1688202,That's a good one.
539,1688327,1691080,"So, here's the thing. My friend
Gene here has a little problem."
540,1691247,1693625,"Well, see,
I'm supposed to be a Meh,"
541,1693750,1694667,but I don't really feel...
542,1694709,1695584,"Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
543,1695710,1697129,"No, that's good.
And we thought"
544,1697254,1698630,"you could help,
since you got the Princess,"
545,1698755,1700757,"you know, off the phone."
546,1700758,1700798,Not interested.
547,1704845,1708056,"Hold up.
That's not a Meh face."
548,1708181,1709599,Bots! They're after me!
549,1717233,1718942,How are you doing that?
550,1719067,1720611,"Look, it's just something I can do.
Can you help us?"
551,1724031,1724991,Follow me.
552,1729078,1730454,Bots! Delete my history!
553,1734333,1735794,"I corrupted
the entire hard drive."
554,1735919,1741090,"I made the most
delicious cinnamon buns."
555,1741215,1745638,"Maybe if there was something
to, you know, jog my memory."
556,1749392,1751810,Come on! Move!
557,1751977,1755439,"Hey, Trolls, why is that
mailbox wearing a tuxedo?"
558,1761571,1764115,"Hi! It's so great to
see you again! Call me!"
559,1771497,1773041,"This tunnel will
get us out of here."
560,1773166,1774335,Move!
561,1798735,1801195,"Did that cloud
taste sweet to you?!"
562,1807535,1809705,Help me! Help! I'm stuck!
563,1809830,1811039,Sweet motherboard!
564,1811206,1812875,Where am I?
565,1816086,1817170,Get me out of here.
566,1817295,1818421,"Hey, Palm Face."
567,1818546,1819715,"Try getting him
out the top!"
568,1819882,1820924,Already on it!
569,1821049,1822425,"Hold tight, Gene."
570,1830769,1832895,"This feels very odd,
and it smells."
571,1833020,1836565,"I mean, it smells good, it smells
delicious, but I still don't like it."
572,1836732,1838777,"The game obviously
thinks you're a candy,"
573,1838902,1842406,"even though you're weirdly
misshapen, you know?"
574,1842531,1843823,What are we gonna do?
575,1843948,1845492,Stay very still.
576,1845617,1849579,"Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?"
577,1851205,1852958,"Hey, Fingers!
You want to focus?"
578,1853083,1854751,"For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,"
579,1854918,1857671,and it's a very serious...
580,1857672,1857712,"Listen, Finger Head!"
581,1857796,1860883,"We have to get Gene out of the
game without blowing him up."
582,1861008,1862218,I don't want to blow up.
583,1862343,1863928,"We have to match
up the candies,"
584,1864053,1865596,"so that Gene will
drop to the bottom."
585,1865721,1869309,"And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else..."
586,1869434,1871394,"Don't do that.
Please don't do that."
587,1871519,1872688,Watch.
588,1875606,1877108,Match three in a row.
589,1877275,1878609,Don't blow Gene up. Got it.
590,1878776,1880446,"And we have to
be very careful."
591,1880612,1883114,"-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful.
-Candy!"
592,1885742,1887494,Watch it!
593,1887495,1887536,Hey!
594,1887619,1889204,"No!
No, no, no! Slow down."
595,1889330,1891207,"Not the yellows!
Not the yellows."
596,1891332,1892791,I said careful!
597,1899465,1904637,"My mom just joined Facebook. Can you
believe she wanted to friend me?"
598,1904804,1908308,"Hey, Addie, I was just
wondering if you are..."
599,1908475,1909226,Tasty.
600,1909267,1909976,What?
601,1910142,1912020,Um... Excuse me?
602,1912145,1913313,Sweet.
603,1913480,1914063,"Hey, Addie!"
604,1914105,1914689,"Hi, Nikki."
605,1914814,1917150,"See you later, Alex."
606,1917317,1918986,Sugar Crush.
607,1919152,1920445,So over this.
608,1926035,1927620,"Wireless Wireless.
How may I help you?"
609,1927745,1929163,"I'd like to make
an appointment."
610,1929330,1931039,"It's like this phone is
playing games with me."
611,1933960,1935586,"Hey, what does this do?"
612,1940133,1942010,No!
613,1942176,1943512,Get me out of here!
614,1949267,1951936,"No! Stop it!
Stop, stop!"
615,1952061,1953480,It's not working.
616,1953605,1955524,"Well, there's
one option left."
617,1955649,1957275,"We line you up
with the yellows."
618,1957402,1958736,But you said not to do that.
619,1958861,1961406,"Special candies get
transported to that jar."
620,1961531,1963823,"The game might think
you're a special candy."
621,1963949,1967286,"And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?"
622,1967411,1968663,Well...
623,1979382,1982303,"Jailbreak, hello?
Hello, Jailbreak?"
624,1982304,1982344,Sorry.
625,1982428,1984345,"What if it doesn't
think I'm a special candy?"
626,1984470,1986723,"I'm not too
worried about it."
627,1988934,1990561,"Okay, just do it."
628,1997193,1998402,Gene!
629,1999528,2000572,Gene?
630,2000697,2003199,Hey. No!
631,2003325,2006911,Gene! You're alive!
632,2007036,2008746,"You were trying to
see if I had somehow"
633,2008871,2010540,"turned into candy,
weren't you?"
634,2010665,2012709,"Yes, I was.
And you have not."
635,2017505,2019382,"Hey. Looks like something
popped up on Alex's calendar."
636,2021594,2023970,I'm sure it's nothing.
637,2024096,2026431,"Alex made an appointment
at the phone store."
638,2028351,2029768,No!
639,2031019,2032980,"Calm down, everyone!"
640,2033105,2034481,Calm down.
641,2034607,2037109,"Don't worry.
Everything is fine."
642,2037235,2040029,"Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories."
643,2040154,2044117,"His appointment is
with technical support."
644,2044242,2048537,"Well, I'm sure we still have
plenty of time to figure this out."
645,2048662,2050707,"His appointment
is for tomorrow."
646,2052918,2055670,"Then maybe it's just for
some routine maintenance."
647,2055795,2058923,"Actually,
it's to erase the phone."
648,2065722,2069601,"Listen, Gene, I'm about to become
your knight in shining armor."
649,2069726,2070394,You are?
650,2070436,2071061,Yeah.
651,2073147,2074940,"But first, we need to get
uploaded to the cloud."
652,2075065,2078069,"That's where we'll find the
source code to reprogram you."
653,2078194,2079570,The cloud?
654,2079695,2081322,Isn't that off the phone?
655,2081447,2083158,"Ding, ding, ding, ding.
You got it."
656,2083283,2085702,"Yeah,
the cloud. Off the phone."
657,2087162,2089164,"We're in Candy Crush, obvs."
658,2089289,2091332,"I know a shortcut
to Just Dance,"
659,2091499,2093126,"which is right
next to Dropbox,"
660,2093251,2095546,"where we can get
uploaded to the cloud."
661,2095671,2097839,"Of course. Just Dance, then
boogie over to Dropbox,"
662,2098006,2099341,"catch the link, and zoom."
663,2099466,2100842,"Hold up.
Here's the stinker."
664,2100967,2102762,"Before they let
us into the cloud,"
665,2102887,2104930,"we have to get
past this firewall."
666,2106390,2108017,"The firewall uses
face identification."
667,2108142,2110186,"Yeah, the firewall."
668,2110311,2112104,"Which is really annoying, because
I've already tried to get through."
669,2112229,2114399,"Guessed wrong once, and now
I'm locked out for life."
670,2114524,2116025,Locked out for life?
671,2116192,2118986,"You're thinking, 'cause I
can make different faces,"
672,2119111,2121406,"the firewall will think
I'm different emojis."
673,2121407,2121448,Yeah.
674,2121531,2123909,"I wanted to say it
'cause it was my idea."
675,2124034,2125743,"You know, women are always
coming up with stuff"
676,2125868,2127037,"that men are
taking credit for."
677,2127162,2128580,You know what...
678,2128705,2130123,"Well, then
let's hit the road."
679,2130248,2131542,"Hi-5, you coming?"
680,2131667,2134670,I'm coming!
681,2134795,2137631,"Why do I always think I'm gonna
come around on black licorice?"
682,2139258,2140843,My precious.
683,2140968,2142220,Hey! Move it!
684,2142345,2144054,"Certain death,
here we come."
685,2147558,2149060,Let's try this one.
686,2149811,2151229,YouTube?
687,2156693,2158904,What a visual treat.
688,2159029,2160989,"And I don't
even need a remote."
689,2164118,2166411,That guy is so expressive.
690,2166536,2168747,He reminds me of Gene.
691,2168872,2171666,"Yeah. Something
really wrong with him."
692,2171791,2174837,"Our son is a malfunction,"
693,2174962,2177923,"and you should never have
let him go into that cube."
694,2178048,2179884,"Don't blame me for this, Mel."
695,2180010,2182261,I am hopping mad at you.
696,2182428,2183428,See?
697,2186265,2188643,"Mary, I think
we're being followed."
698,2188768,2190478,But don't overreact.
699,2192147,2194858,I told you not to overreact.
700,2199988,2201448,What are you doing now?
701,2205995,2208748,They'll be in there for hours.
702,2221719,2223388,"Mary, where are you going?"
703,2223513,2225974,"I think we should go
our separate ways, Mel."
704,2226099,2228726,"I thought I knew
the Meh that I married,"
705,2228851,2230478,but maybe I don't.
706,2231188,2232730,"But, Mary..."
707,2236109,2238528,"This tunnel will help us
avoid the Bots."
708,2238654,2241282,"Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you."
709,2241407,2243993,"NBD, dude. The truth is,
you're helping me."
710,2244160,2246161,"Come on, let's move it.
Why so slow?"
711,2246328,2249207,"Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so
close? What's with you? Back off."
712,2249332,2251334,"Can't stop now.
I'm having a sugar rush!"
713,2251459,2254504,"I'll go around you. If I stop
moving, my heart's gonna explode!"
714,2254671,2256422,"Coming through,
Jailbreak! Look out!"
715,2256547,2258508,"Hey!
Watch it, Knuckle Butt!"
716,2258675,2260343,I can't feel my face.
717,2260509,2263429,"So, Jailbreak, back there
you said I'm helping you."
718,2263555,2266015,"I've been trying to get past
that firewall for months."
719,2266141,2267934,"Come on, come on!"
720,2268059,2269186,"The faster we get there, the
faster I become a favorite!"
721,2271187,2272732,Look at me!
722,2272857,2274566,"I just want to
bounce out of here,"
723,2274691,2276401,"get off the phone,
and live on the cloud."
724,2281698,2283033,What just happened?
725,2283159,2285077,You don't like it here?
726,2285202,2288623,"There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?"
727,2288748,2290208,"The cloud is
supposed to be amazing."
728,2290375,2292543,"There's so much to
see and do."
729,2292710,2294963,Sugar crash.
730,2295088,2296214,I can't hold on anymore.
731,2296381,2298549,"Catch me, Gene. Catch me!"
732,2298716,2300469,"And you can be
whoever you want."
733,2303138,2304515,Thanks.
734,2304640,2305932,You're free! Come on!
735,2308394,2310103,"My gosh,
my hands are sweating."
736,2310228,2311605,You are a hand!
737,2314567,2315776,Yeah!
738,2320614,2322158,"You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember"
739,2322283,2324410,"there ever being
a hacker emoji."
740,2324535,2328581,"Um, you know, you're taking up
too much of my brain space."
741,2328706,2330500,"Let's keep
the chitchat to a minimum."
742,2332127,2333461,Someone likes you.
743,2333586,2335423,What are you talking about?
744,2335548,2338300,"This is just like when Peace
Sign gave me just one finger."
745,2338425,2339802,"I knew she was
in love with me."
746,2339927,2341928,Let's go!
747,2342095,2344765,"I'm never eating another
piece of candy ever again."
748,2347268,2349687,"Hi-5, don't do it."
749,2349813,2352440,"Don't you do it. It's
already been in there once."
750,2354067,2355443,Don't do it.
751,2358279,2359863,Are my fingers getting fat?
752,2359988,2362283,"I'll tell you what, this bandage
wasn't so tight before."
753,2367289,2371418,"Okay. We get through this app, and
Dropbox is right on the other side."
754,2371543,2374128,"We just need to keep
it super DL in here."
755,2374254,2377632,"And no matter what,
we can't turn it on."
756,2381971,2384306,"OMG, this turned it on!"
757,2385725,2388603,"What? I'm a hand.
It's a big, red button."
758,2402659,2403326,What's happening?
759,2403368,2403994,"No, no, no, no, no!"
760,2405495,2407998,Welcome to Just Dance!
761,2408123,2411585,"Follow my moves
and you get to move forward."
762,2411710,2415005,"Do the wrong moves
and you get an ""X."""
763,2415130,2418092,Three strikes and you're out.
764,2418217,2420470,"Out? What does
she mean by ""Out""?"
765,2420595,2422679,Digital death.
766,2422804,2426225,"Thanks to you, Fingers. Now we're
gonna have to dance our way out."
767,2426350,2429520,"Which is all right with me, 'cause
I can shake it like Michael."
768,2429687,2431064,"Or Michael's glove, anyway."
769,2431189,2436068,Are you ready to dance?
770,2436194,2439822,"This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove."
771,2439947,2441950,"Come on.
Everybody can dance."
772,2442075,2445704,"Not me, okay?
I'm really stiff."
773,2445871,2449333,"See? I can't...
Don't understand."
774,2449500,2450959,"Okay. No, no..."
775,2451084,2452628,"Stop, stop. She has to stop."
776,2452753,2455714,"I see now what you are saying.
Just follow her moves."
777,2455840,2458258,Ready to dance in three...
778,2458383,2459928,This I can't do.
779,2460053,2460803,Two...
780,2460844,2461554,Dude...
781,2461720,2464015,Just shut up and...
782,2464016,2464057,Dance!
783,2477821,2482076,"It's too easy!
Hee-hee! Shamone!"
784,2495090,2496090,Jailbreak!
785,2497758,2499719,I got you.
786,2499844,2501597,Look. Just feel the music.
787,2501763,2502847,Express yourself.
788,2502848,2503931,Through dance?
789,2507685,2509354,"Yeah, you got it! Go, girl!"
790,2509480,2513024,"Now throw some sauce
on that dance burrito."
791,2513149,2515026,I'm doing it!
792,2515151,2517446,I'm fully nailing this dance!
793,2520074,2521992,You got it!
794,2528207,2531460,"Great job! You're
moving on to free dance!"
795,2531585,2534881,"Impress us with your
moves to move forward."
796,2535006,2536590,More dancing?
797,2548979,2551607,"You're killing it, Gene! Slay!"
798,2554777,2557864,"Nice! Shake it, Gene.
You won't break it."
799,2557989,2559365,Wait a minute!
800,2559490,2561659,"I've never seen
that dance before."
801,2561785,2563452,What's it called?
802,2563577,2566664,Um... The Emoji Pop?
803,2569167,2571919,I love it!
804,2572045,2574255,What? You do?
805,2576841,2582055,"Everybody, do the Emoji Pop!"
806,2597238,2598614,Hoo!
807,2598739,2600032,Yes!
808,2607247,2609167,Princess.
809,2609292,2611545,"You're the
Princess emoji?"
810,2612712,2613879,You never got off the phone.
811,2614004,2616549,"Welcome, new players!"
812,2616717,2617217,What?
813,2617258,2617717,Who?
814,2617842,2619052,No!
815,2626310,2627143,We got to go.
816,2627186,2628019,Don't worry.
817,2628144,2630647,"They're robots.
They can't dance."
818,2630772,2632984,Downloading funk protocol.
819,2641117,2643245,"""Can't dance,"" he says."
820,2650252,2652379,Move!
821,2652504,2655257,"Congratulations.
You're a disco diva."
822,2655423,2657260,"Hey, Alex,
you gonna dance for us?"
823,2658927,2660429,"Alex,
that's extra homework for you."
824,2661972,2663892,"Hey, Alex,
you gonna shake it?"
825,2664017,2665684,"No! No, no,
no, no, no, no!"
826,2669605,2671274,"Alex must be
deleting the app."
827,2676612,2678323,Watch out!
828,2682619,2684578,We got to get out of here.
829,2684703,2686248,Come on!
830,2686373,2687999,This song is my jam.
831,2688124,2690627,"Hi-5, come on! Let's go!"
832,2697217,2698718,Hurry!
833,2703891,2704642,Hi-5!
834,2704684,2705434,Gene!
835,2706561,2707853,I got you!
836,2712650,2714444,Gene...
837,2714569,2715611,Hi-5!
838,2732213,2734422,Gene.
839,2735758,2739136,"Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?"
840,2739303,2741055,Alex trashed the app.
841,2742307,2744183,"And Hi-5
right along with it."
842,2744350,2746143,"Wait, what? Wait, trashed?"
843,2746269,2748062,Hi-5 is in the trash?
844,2748187,2749647,He wanted to dance.
845,2749772,2752650,But I knew it was a bad idea.
846,2752776,2755111,"We got to get
him out of there."
847,2755236,2759658,"Gene, Dropbox is right here.
That's our ticket to the cloud."
848,2759783,2762035,"And the trash is on
the other side of the phone."
849,2762202,2764204,"We don't know how many
other Bots are out there."
850,2765080,2766206,I'm sorry.
851,2766374,2768416,"No way.
We can't go without Hi-5."
852,2768542,2771254,"I don't care how
far away it is."
853,2771379,2773422,That's my friend down there.
854,2773547,2775508,"I'm not just gonna
leave him to get deleted."
855,2776885,2779595,What? What is it?
856,2779720,2783224,"I've always just thought you got
to look out for number one."
857,2783391,2784726,"Well, what good is
it to be number one"
858,2784851,2786227,"if there aren't
any other numbers?"
859,2789564,2791566,Okay.
860,2791733,2794402,"I'm sorry.
This is my malfunction."
861,2794528,2797155,"I just... I can't be
meh about anything."
862,2797281,2799324,"This is why I'm going
to get reprogrammed."
863,2800575,2803913,"Well, it's actually
kind of cool."
864,2804079,2805581,"Wait, really?"
865,2808083,2811045,"You know, I think
I know a shortcut."
866,2811170,2813756,"We can take
the music streams in Spotify."
867,2813881,2815759,"Let's go give
that big hand a hand."
868,2817343,2818344,Come on.
869,2828354,2831483,"Alex trashed the Just Dance
app, and our Bots are offline,"
870,2831608,2833819,"and it's giving
me a real headache."
871,2833945,2835987,I am so angry.
872,2836112,2837949,I really need to stay happy.
873,2838115,2839658,"Can we please
lighten the mood?"
874,2841618,2843996,"No one can resist
una fiesta!"
875,2846748,2848042,Not that happy.
876,2850252,2853047,"We've only got four hours before
Alex's phone appointment."
877,2853172,2857051,"If they find a malfunction on the
phone, we are all gonna be wiped."
878,2857176,2858804,Yeah.
879,2858971,2860597,"She said, ""Wiped."""
880,2861890,2863475,"Aim higher, Steven."
881,2863641,2865143,"I didn't want to
have to do this,"
882,2865269,2866770,"but it is fun
to press buttons."
883,2870482,2872360,The illegal upgrade.
884,2880076,2881994,Now that makes me happy.
885,2889585,2891170,I just want to dance.
886,2891295,2892630,"Dance, please."
887,2892756,2895008,"Arr! Quiet,
you sassy gypsy."
888,2899346,2900890,Where am I?
889,2901015,2902516,"Hi! It's so great
to see you again!"
890,2902682,2904894,"You're in the trash,
Fingers for Brains."
891,2905019,2906728,"Get away from me, Troll."
892,2906729,2906770,Hi!
893,2906853,2908313,"It's so great
to see you again!"
894,2908439,2910190,I got to get out of here.
895,2910191,2910232,You can't.
896,2910357,2911817,"And at the end of the day,"
897,2911942,2914820,"the trash gets emptied,
and we're all gonna die!"
898,2914945,2916489,"No. No, no!"
899,2916656,2919200,"This is the last
face you will ever see."
900,2920243,2922495,No!
901,2936802,2939095,This is Spotify?
902,2939096,2939137,Yep.
903,2939220,2941890,"Every one of those streams
is a different song."
904,2942057,2943684,Is it safe?
905,2950191,2952151,Yeah!
906,2953986,2957282,"Are you sure
this is a good idea?"
907,2957407,2959408,"Fastest way to the trash,
dude!"
908,2959576,2962370,"Could we at least
pick a calmer stream?"
909,2962537,2964081,"Okay, buzzkill."
910,2970753,2973256,"Alex. A bunch of people
are hitting the promenade."
911,2973381,2974758,"I think Addie
might be there, too."
912,2974883,2976218,That's perfect!
913,2976343,2977719,"I have an appointment
down there, anyway."
914,2977886,2979222,"I've got to get
this phone fixed."
915,2980639,2981681,"Hey, bubble butt."
916,2981808,2982766,"Yeah, you do."
917,2985561,2988063,Much better.
918,2988188,2989941,"So, I got to ask."
919,2990066,2991942,"Is it true that when
a princess whistles,"
920,2992067,2993903,"birds fly down
from the skies, and..."
921,2994070,2997574,"Hello, stereotype. That is
a complete and total myth."
922,2997699,2999826,I'm sorry.
923,2999951,3002536,"Did you realize that
on the first emoji set,"
924,3002662,3005540,"a woman can either be
a princess or a bride?"
925,3005665,3007584,"That's why I need
to get to the cloud,"
926,3007709,3009628,"where you can be
whoever you want to be."
927,3009794,3012214,"Get ready.
Whale song coming."
928,3012339,3014467,"-Wait, wait. Whale what?
-A whale song."
929,3014592,3016801,"From Alex's
biology presentation."
930,3028148,3030816,"You're not gonna see that
sitting around in a cube."
931,3033319,3037448,"It's funny. You want out of
the cube, and I want in."
932,3037573,3043455,"Gene, if that means you can't
be yourself, what's the point?"
933,3043580,3047126,"You know, I think you're pretty
cool just the way you are."
934,3060515,3062683,"We're
gonna need this."
935,3075738,3080035,"In the trash? Me?
I used to be somebody."
936,3080160,3083663,"Here I am. Look. In an old
e-mail Alex never sent."
937,3083831,3086333,"""Addie, blah, blah, blah,
blah, bla-la-la-la."""
938,3087500,3089087,"And then there's me, Hi-5,"
939,3089212,3091380,"right there, doing my job."
940,3093341,3096677,"FYI, nobody cares about you."
941,3096802,3100723,"Just leave me,
Troll, and let me die"
942,3100890,3103393,in this dump alone.
943,3103518,3106230,"Let me look for the world's
smallest violin in here,"
944,3106355,3109984,so you can play it.
945,3110109,3113570,"It's the Hand Angel of Mercy.
She's finally come for me."
946,3115322,3116406,Give me your hand!
947,3116532,3118200,"I mean, give me yourself."
948,3118325,3120035,"Take my hand, angel."
949,3122329,3124915,"I'm ready to take my place amongst
the other great hands of the past."
950,3125082,3127252,"It's me, Gene!"
951,3127253,3127293,Gene?
952,3127377,3128711,The one and only.
953,3128878,3130839,I got him!
954,3134175,3135510,Take me with you.
955,3136177,3137388,Hi-5!
956,3137513,3138679,Let go of me.
957,3138805,3140515,Don't leave me down here!
958,3142183,3144978,"You were wrong, Troll.
People do care about me."
959,3145103,3146563,"And I'm not upset, Troll."
960,3146688,3149816,"Do you see how
not upset I am?"
961,3151527,3154822,"Gene,
you came back for me."
962,3154947,3156615,You saved me.
963,3156740,3158743,"It wasn't just me.
Jailbreak helped, too."
964,3158910,3160911,"And she's a hugger.
Give her a squeeze."
965,3161037,3162079,"No, no, no."
966,3162204,3164623,"There really is
nothing greater"
967,3164748,3167043,"than the feeling
of being truly free."
968,3172716,3175259,"You filthy trolls,
I inhaled your stench,"
969,3175385,3178680,"but I was once one of you,
so I, too, feel your pain."
970,3178805,3180808,Now go. Be free!
971,3182225,3184019,"Should be smooth
sailing from here."
972,3195781,3197158,Gene.
973,3201037,3202330,Gene.
974,3207585,3208962,Gene?
975,3209087,3210964,Are you Instagramming?
976,3220140,3222142,Where is my Gene?
977,3249504,3251089,Mary.
978,3251215,3253383,"You've really
done it this time."
979,3254426,3255511,"No, you haven't."
980,3255636,3257221,Mel?
981,3257388,3260474,"What are you doing in Alex's
trip to France album?"
982,3260599,3262476,I was looking for you.
983,3262601,3264979,"None of this is
your fault, Mary."
984,3265104,3266647,It's mine.
985,3266772,3267940,What do you mean?
986,3273988,3276699,"Is that a tear
on your cheek?"
987,3276866,3279536,"It's my fault Gene
is the way he is."
988,3279661,3281704,"I have other
expressions, too."
989,3281871,3284332,"I think they've
just been buried away."
990,3284457,3289338,"But with Gene going missing and
thinking I might have lost you, too..."
991,3289463,3293217,"Mel.
Why didn't you tell me?"
992,3293342,3295928,I didn't know myself.
993,3296054,3301100,"Right now, I'm so overwhelmed
with passionate feelings for you."
994,3307023,3310610,"Mary, my love for you
burns with the intensity"
995,3310735,3312821,of a red-hot flame.
996,3312946,3314781,"I like that, Mel."
997,3316991,3318952,Let's go find our son.
998,3319077,3320286,Together.
999,3324834,3327043,"We'll always have
Paris, Mary."
1000,3332091,3333759,"So, you're a princess."
1001,3333884,3336429,"I saw your little tiara.
Very fancy."
1002,3336554,3338681,"Is it true when
a princess whistles,"
1003,3338806,3339682,birds fly down from...
1004,3339724,3340600,That's what I said!
1005,3340725,3343103,"No, guys!
That's a stupid myth!"
1006,3343228,3345897,"What software version
are we living in?"
1007,3346022,3347273,Go read an e-book.
1008,3347440,3348774,Educate yourselves.
1009,3348941,3350819,Just look behind you.
1010,3350820,3350861,What the...
1011,3353280,3354740,What is that?
1012,3354865,3356325,"Smiler must have
upgraded her Bots."
1013,3356450,3357451,"Let's get out
of here before it..."
1014,3357576,3359829,"Hi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler."
1015,3359996,3362372,"I'm coming to you live
from the amphitheater."
1016,3362498,3364708,"Why don't you come
back to Textopolis"
1017,3364833,3367211,"and we can talk through
our differences, okay?"
1018,3367336,3369546,"My friend here will
escort you, all right?"
1019,3369671,3372633,"I'm gonna see you soon,
buddy. Bye, now."
1020,3372758,3375512,"We're actually gonna delete
him in front of everyone."
1021,3375637,3376720,Psst! It's still on!
1022,3376762,3377764,It's still what?
1023,3377889,3380016,Jiminy Sassafras!
1024,3381726,3383102,Move!
1025,3390902,3392237,Separate!
1026,3409923,3411215,Tangle him up!
1027,3416763,3418139,Jailbreak!
1028,3418264,3419348,Gene! This way!
1029,3419473,3420725,It's still after me!
1030,3420726,3420767,Over here!
1031,3429901,3431195,Let's go.
1032,3433363,3435074,"We have to
make it to Dropbox."
1033,3439954,3441414,Yes!
1034,3441539,3442457,No!
1035,3442498,3443373,Go low!
1036,3453176,3454802,"Don't worry.
It can't get in."
1037,3454927,3457305,"It's illegal malware,

1038,3461767,3463729,Come on.
1039,3463895,3465230,Welcome to Dropbox.
1040,3465355,3467066,"You are about to
leave the phone."
1041,3467191,3469067,"Remain seated, please."
1042,3471403,3473364,You might want to hang on.
1043,3473489,3475574,"Why do they call
this Dropbox, anyway?"
1044,3475699,3477785,"This is why!
I see that now!"
1045,3480997,3482039,Yeah!
1046,3485793,3487587,"I think we're about to see
that candy corn again!"
1047,3493050,3494177,We made it.
1048,3494302,3495971,Hoo!
1049,3496138,3499141,"Guys, guys, chill. We still
have to get past that."
1050,3509318,3510193,Holy...

1055,3516534,3518327,"All right, here goes."
1056,3518328,3518369,What do I do?
1057,3518452,3520663,"Sit in the corner
and don't say a word."
1058,3520830,3522874,"Keep those sausage
fingers to yourself."
1059,3522999,3525168,"Yes, Your Majesty
Princess of Nightmares!"
1060,3525293,3527879,"Now, Gene, step onto
the password icon,"
1061,3528004,3529464,"and I'll feed you
the passwords."
1062,3529631,3530632,Okay.

every time I mess up?"
1068,3550528,3551987,"Yeah, kinda."
1069,3552113,3553406,"What do you mean, ""Kinda""?"
1070,3553531,3555075,Ready?
1071,3555200,3557368,Welcome to the firewall.

his favorite grandma."
1088,3599621,3600998,"I'm sorry, Gene."
1089,3601123,3602749,I let us all down.
1090,3604793,3608005,"You know, if I had to
come up with a password,"
1091,3608130,3610382,"I'd probably use
the name of a girl I liked."
1092,3610508,3612092,I've been all over the phone.
1093,3612259,3614303,He's never mentioned a girl.
1094,3614428,3616389,"Yes, he has."
1095,3616514,3620226,"Hi. When I was in the trash, I
read a very interesting e-mail,"
1096,3620351,3624230,"but I'm just the dunce in the
corner, forbidden to speak."
1097,3624355,3625273,What e-mail?
1098,3625314,3626232,"Sorry, what?"
1099,3626357,3627358,What e-mail?
1100,3627483,3628902,To a girl at school.
1101,3629027,3630612,"He was declaring his
feelings of love for her."
1102,3630737,3633948,"I guess instead of sending it,
he tossed it in the trash."
1103,3634115,3635910,"Hi-5, this is very important."
1104,3636076,3637411,What is her name?
1105,3637536,3639704,"Her name, yes.
Excellent question."
1106,3639830,3642165,It was Tina.
1107,3642291,3643458,Karen.
1108,3643583,3645920,Marge. Lindsey.
1109,3646045,3648005,Alison.

now I'm saying it out loud."
1113,3655137,3656807,Jennifer.
1114,3656932,3658766,Got to find that e-mail.
1115,3658767,3658808,Phillipa.

1135,3729007,3732636,"One little emoji could sure get
lost in a place like this."
1136,3737015,3740101,"I guess we should
make you a Meh"
1137,3740226,3742521,"before that Bot
comes back?"
1138,3742646,3746441,"So, we're gonna...
We're gonna do that now?"
1139,3747567,3749403,We had a deal.
1140,3749528,3751155,Right?
1141,3751280,3754033,"Yeah, okay. Right."
1142,3754199,3756744,"I, guess
I'll start hacking."
1143,3779100,3780727,"We did it, Gene."
1144,3780894,3782729,"All our dreams
are coming true."
1145,3782854,3786107,"I'll be an Alex favorite again,
and you'll be a real Meh."
1146,3786232,3787526,Yeah!
1147,3792990,3795743,"Yeah, but this all seems kind
of super-fast now, though."
1148,3795910,3797912,Doesn't it?
1149,3798037,3801833,"Hi-5, I just didn't expect to be
having these feelings right now."
1150,3801958,3805087,"Well, maybe you should go and
express them while you still can."
1151,3810633,3814221,"So, I've been...
I mean, um..."
1152,3814346,3817390,Ever since we...
1153,3817515,3821394,"Jailbreak, you're the coolest, most
interesting emoji I've ever met."
1154,3821519,3824232,"And after all
the adventures that we had,"
1155,3824357,3826484,"I'm just not sure I
want all that to go away,"
1156,3826650,3830822,"because my feelings
right now are, like, huge."
1157,3830989,3834993,"I just think that they could be enough
for me to want to stay the way I am."
1158,3835118,3837621,"If it means I could
stay here with you."
1159,3837746,3838705,"Like, forever."
1160,3838830,3841124,Forever and ever and ever.
1161,3841250,3843001,Maybe longer than that even.
1162,3844003,3845420,Like in the fairy tales.
1163,3850635,3854095,"Like, what is ""?
Is that a good ""?"
1164,3854221,3857933,"Gene, if this is about
you deciding not to be meh,"
1165,3858058,3860352,then I am all about that.
1166,3861646,3863731,"I like you just
the way you are."
1167,3865358,3867192,But I had a plan.
1168,3869987,3871697,Right.
1169,3871823,3875494,"I'm not just some princess,
Gene, waiting for my prince."
1170,3878914,3882208,"I mean, what you said
was beautiful, but..."
1171,3883835,3885378,Gene.
1172,3886838,3889340,You're all meh.
1173,3889466,3890927,The source code worked!
1174,3891052,3893930,Turns out I didn't need it.
1175,3894055,3897725,"For the first time in my
life, meh is all I feel."
1176,3899726,3902396,No! Gene!
1177,3902521,3904691,"Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early."
1178,3904857,3906693,"No problem.
I can take you right now."
1179,3926755,3927881,Jailbreak!
1180,3928006,3929550,Don't do that!
1181,3929675,3932761,"That freaky huge Bot has got
Gene back inside the phone."
1182,3932887,3934805,What?
1183,3934930,3937100,"He left looking more meh than the
meh-est meh face I've ever seen."
1184,3937225,3938434,What did you say to him?
1185,3939811,3941937,It's what I didn't say.
1186,3943315,3944899,We've got to go get him.
1187,3945066,3947944,"How are we gonna get in there
in time before he gets deleted?"
1188,3948069,3951072,"I can't
believe I'm doing this."
1189,3951198,3954451,"You tell anyone you saw this, and
I'll crack more than those knuckles."
1190,3995577,3997954,Birds do love princesses!
1191,3998121,3999290,It's not a myth.
1192,3999415,4001292,It's not a myth at all!
1193,4003294,4005129,"What happened to
becoming a favorite?"
1194,4005254,4007465,"Guess I'd rather
have one real friend."
1195,4007632,4009258,And let's go get him.
1196,4013638,4016348,"I can't wait to see
the look on Gene's face!"
1197,4018476,4020979,Look at that expression.
1198,4023190,4027152,"Is that for realizing you've
put all of Textopolis at risk,"
1199,4027278,4029738,"causing Alex to
question our reliability?"
1200,4032074,4034493,"Hey, that's going
too far, even for me."
1201,4034618,4038206,"If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,"
1202,4038331,4040666,"they'll discover there's
nothing wrong with the phone."
1203,4040791,4042543,Any last words?
1204,4043627,4044837,Meh.
1205,4045004,4046172,"Well, it's too late for that."
1206,4046297,4048383,Delete him!
1207,4048384,4048425,Wait.
1208,4051344,4054514,"You delete Gene, you'll
have to delete me, too."
1209,4054681,4058351,"I have the same
malfunction Gene does."
1210,4061688,4062898,Dad?
1211,4063023,4065234,"Gosh,
I don't know what to do."
1212,4065359,4066361,"Yes, I do."
1213,4066527,4067695,Bot!
1214,4069029,4070240,No!
1215,4070365,4072032,"Sorry, Mrs. Meh."
1216,4077622,4079915,"I did not see
that one coming."
1217,4080082,4081709,"Smiler, I think
you might be making"
1218,4081876,4083461,"too much stink
out of all this."
1219,4083586,4086631,"Really?
How about you're next?"
1220,4089843,4091428,"I was wrong, Gene."
1221,4091553,4094222,"I should've believed
in you all along."
1222,4094348,4097475,"What a touching
daddy-son reunion moment."
1223,4097600,4100228,"It reminds me of
the time I deleted you both."
1224,4100396,4102273,Wait. That's this time!
1225,4102398,4104483,Delete the two malfunctions!
1226,4106693,4107778,No.
1227,4110406,4112409,How's that for an...
1228,4121000,4122376,Great.
1229,4132929,4134598,I can't reach!
1230,4148988,4152033,"No! What did you
do to my beautiful..."
1231,4152158,4154619,My tooth.
1232,4158082,4159666,"Hand, button."
1233,4162294,4163878,Jailbreak?
1234,4164003,4165297,Gene.
1235,4167007,4168884,You really are a Meh.
1236,4169009,4171345,"What happened to looking out
for number one?"
1237,4171511,4173472,"Being number
one doesn't matter"
1238,4173598,4175515,"if there aren't
any other numbers."
1239,4178435,4179354,Alex's appointment!
1240,4179520,4181021,He's deleting the phone!
1241,4181146,4182858,"No, no, no!"
1242,4182983,4184859,Show me Alex.
1243,4188238,4189655,"Are you sure you want
to delete everything?"
1244,4189823,4190824,Do it.
1245,4195954,4197789,Red alert! Red alert!
1246,4197914,4199499,"Alex, no!"
1247,4206882,4208384,Game over.
1248,4210970,4213889,"Fellas, I'm afraid
this is last call."
1249,4214014,4216934,"Dude, Addie's here.
You should go over."
1250,4220354,4223275,"Every time I try,
I screw it up."
1251,4223400,4225527,"I don't know how to
tell her how I feel."
1252,4225652,4228781,"If we help Alex connect to
Addie, maybe he won't delete us."
1253,4228906,4231783,"I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him."
1254,4231908,4233535,"But we'll only
have time to send one."
1255,4233702,4234702,Maybe I should go.
1256,4234827,4236664,He has love in his eyes.
1257,4236789,4239208,"Send me.
Alex looks nervous, too."
1258,4239333,4241376,He's more shy than nervous.
1259,4241544,4242544,Stop!
1260,4244172,4245506,It's Gene.
1261,4245631,4248342,He's all of those things.
1262,4248467,4251179,"An emoji
should only be one thing."
1263,4251304,4252430,Really?
1264,4253682,4254849,The Princess!
1265,4254974,4256059,Linda!
1266,4256225,4258019,"Not now, Mom!"
1267,4258144,4260605,"Gene, you got this."
1268,4262065,4263943,That's not me anymore.
1269,4271951,4273618,But I have to try.
1270,4273743,4275663,It's starting!
1271,4275788,4277247,"No, it's ending!"
1272,4295767,4297936,I'm working on it.
1273,4301106,4302232,Mom? Dad?
1274,4303942,4304943,No.
1275,4305526,4307571,I'm in.
1276,4307696,4310824,"Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up."
1277,4310950,4314245,"Gene, why do you
think I came back?"
1278,4314370,4315829,It's because of you.
1279,4316747,4318624,Me?
1280,4318791,4320752,"It's all inside of you, Gene."
1281,4320877,4322962,Just try to bring it back.
1282,4323712,4325256,And do you.
1283,4326465,4327550,Hi-5!
1284,4327675,4328718,I don't want to wave good-bye.
1285,4329677,4331304,"It's now or never, Gene."
