We just stay away from the flocks."
727,4067926,4069553,How you plan on doing that?
728,4069653,4073382,"RAY: Oh, we got ourselves a canary
in a coal mine, my friend."
729,4073482,4077995,"Hey, Denise, you want to show them and I'll
finish cooking the burgers with your son?"
730,4080539,4084535,"DENISE: My brother's doing more to help me
out now than he ever did when he was human."
731,4085185,4087956,I still hate to see him like this.
732,4088656,4091350,"- He's a phoner?
- Yup. Yeah."
733,4091450,4095506,"He's like a little calf that broke off
from the herd and got lost."
734,4095754,4098073,"On its own, he's nothing."
735,4098173,4102053,"He just sits here and waits for them to
come back and find it or else he dies."
736,4103762,4107483,"God, he hasn't been eating.
Come on, don't do this to me."
737,4108683,4114539,"If a flock passes within a mile or so,
he starts coming to and acting up."
738,4114888,4118219,"The closer they are, the crazier he gets.
That's why we got him covered up."
739,4118319,4121680,"We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us."
740,4122706,4124984,"(SIGHS) Come on, don't do this to me."

still recognize my voice."

- Whoa, whoa, whoa."

751,4153854,4158016,"TOM: Do not listen to that shit.

for me because they're in my head."
760,4270663,4273049,"First it was in my dreams, but now
I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake."

762,4276134,4278512,"You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating."

red hoodie is putting thoughts in my mind."
764,4282300,4285969,"And what the Prez wants, he's not gonna
get because you're not gonna let him."
765,4286069,4289473,"They thought it was me, but it wasn't me.
It wasn't me, it's you. He was wrong."
766,4289573,4293502,"- You're the man, my artist. You are it.
- What's that around your neck, Ray?"
767,4293602,4297297,"I don't like it that you're holding on
to your kid because your kid is done."
768,4297397,4300001,"You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast. Your kid is toast."
