257,1136426,1138470,"But my child wasn't sick
when I promised you. There's--"
258,1138554,1140681,"It's not my fault you can't find
a babysitter."
259,1140764,1144059,"Okay, fine. One hour.
I can come in for one hour. That is it."
260,1144143,1145727,"-Fine.
-If Alex beeps me, I'm gone."
261,1145811,1147563,"You can fire me if you want to,
but I'm gone."
262,1147646,1148772,-Karen--
263,1148856,1151942,"And, Charlie, I just want you to know
that you're putting me in the position"
264,1152025,1153819,"of having to choose
between making a house payment"
265,1153902,1155320,"and taking care of my sick child,"
266,1155404,1157489,"-and I really don't appreciate it.
-Karen--"
267,1159199,1160367,Jerk.
268,1161660,1163453,Sh--Okay.
269,1164538,1166957,"Did you tell Charlie
that I'm desperately ill?"
270,1167040,1168625,"Thank you, Alex."
271,1170169,1171879,Yes. Charlie knows you're sick.
272,1172421,1174214,What about the Family Leave Act?
273,1175215,1177217,"I just have to go in
and pick up some stuff"
274,1177301,1179761,"and sign some papers
and show my face."
275,1179845,1181972,"I'll be gone an hour
at the very most."
276,1182723,1185100,"I called Mrs. Hess and told her
you'd be alone, and she--"
277,1185184,1187686,"You called Mrs. Hess?
She knows I'm gonna be alone?"
278,1187769,1190355,"She said if anything comes up,
she'll be right over."
279,1191231,1192232,"She wasn't happy about it, but--"
280,1192316,1193859,"She could get tanked up
on iced tea"
281,1193942,1195861,"and come over
and make me smoke cigarettes."
282,1195944,1199364,"-Oh, don't be ridiculous.
-What do I do if there's a tornado?"
283,1199448,1201992,"-They don't happen in winter.
-Social unrest?"
284,1202075,1204286,"-I don't think so.
-Boredom?"
285,1204369,1206121,I hear it's deadly in old folks.
286,1206205,1207497,"Good-bye, sweetie."
287,1210000,1212044,What about crooks?
288,1214463,1216882,"I don't think that's a problem
during the day, honey."
289,1216965,1219468,"Why not?
Nobody's home during the day."
290,1219551,1221887,"I'm only eight,
and I figured that out."
291,1221970,1224723,"Don't you think a grown-up crook
could figure it out too?"
292,1225766,1227976,This is a very safe neighborhood.
293,1228060,1229728,"There's only one road
in and out of here."
294,1230145,1232272,"The doors will be locked.
You have all my numbers."
295,1232981,1234900,"-I'll be home as soon as I can.
-But, Mom!"
296,1234983,1237945,"What about dragons,
giant spiders, mummies,"
297,1238028,1240989,"the living dead
and other figments of my imagination?"
298,1241073,1244284,"Alex, I can't help you there."
299,1244368,1246745,"Only you can control
your imagination."
300,1249831,1251375,That's a scary thought.

314,1391181,1392599,Are you by yourself?
315,1392682,1395060,"My mom just had to run out
for a few minutes."
316,1395143,1396311,I have the chicken pox.
317,1396395,1398063,"Can I have your address, please?"
318,1398146,1400899,"The guy isn't at my house.
He's at the Stephans'."
319,1400982,1403777,"Their address
is 3015 Washington Street!"

-What?"
326,1463295,1464296,I saw him with my telescope.
327,1464379,1466381,"There's a woman with a dog
and a gray van..."
328,1466465,1467757,and a man in running clothes.
329,1467841,1469885,"I didn't recognize anybody
but the dog."
330,1469968,1472971,"He looked just like Johnny Allen's dog.
So I called the police."
331,1473054,1475432,"-(sirens wailing)
-You called the police?"
332,1478852,1480896,"-(sirens stop)

339,1514554,1517516,"The burglar alarm
was on and working."
340,1517599,1518642,There was no one in the house.
341,1519267,1521603,"It doesn't appear that
anything's been taken."
342,1521686,1523605,"I don't know
what your boy saw, but..."
343,1523688,1525357,there wasn't a person in that house.
344,1525440,1527317,(Karen sighs)
345,1527400,1530820,"I-I'm very sorry about this.
My son's been home with the chicken pox,"
346,1530904,1533448,"and I just had to run to work
to pick up some papers."
347,1533532,1536034,"I'm completely strapped.
I don't normally do this."
348,1537202,1540497,"Son, false alarms
are no joking matter."
349,1540580,1543124,"It wasn't a false alarm.
There was a guy in the house."
350,1543208,1546253,"He had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray van."
351,1546336,1548296,He's been running a fever.
352,1548380,1551299,"You might want to remind him
that ours is serious business."
353,1551383,1553593,Oh. He knows.
354,1553677,1555303,"We gave him a police set
for Christmas."
355,1555387,1557264,"Not this Christmas,
but last Christmas."
356,1557347,1558557,"You know, one of those--"
357,1558640,1561476,"A badge and a hat and a whistle.
He took it very seriously."
358,1561560,1564271,"He went around the house
arresting relatives for various crimes."
359,1564354,1565522,"Oh, you know, not real crimes."
360,1565605,1568817,"Just sort of leaving the toilet
seat up and snoring and--"
361,1570151,1573238,Absolutely. I will. Yes. Thank you.

367,1585584,1588128,"Excuse me, but I saw a man
in Karen Stephans' bedroom."
368,1588211,1590505,"A white male, a little older than Dad,"
369,1590589,1592924,"and he was wearing
butt-inspection gloves."
370,1593008,1595677,"I have warned you
about that telescope."
371,1595760,1596803,"You look through it long enough,"
372,1596886,1599764,"you're gonna start seeing things,
whether or not they're there."
373,1599848,1603101,"I guess you have to be 35
before anyone around here listens to you."
374,1603184,1605228,"Don't get smart with me, Alex."
375,1605312,1607314,"Sick or not,
I am very angry with you."
376,1607397,1609691,"You have caused
a lot of trouble today."

a door at the Stephans'."
378,1611985,1613028,"Do you think
we're happy about that?"

388,1644017,1646478,we've got to find that chip.
389,1649648,1651900,"ALICE: What went wrong
with the burglar alarm?"
390,1651983,1653610,Nothing. It wasn't the alarm.
391,1653693,1655070,Then who called the police?
392,1656196,1658740,"Mr. Jernigan, care to speculate?"
393,1658823,1662118,"ALICE: Cars came and went.
The mailman came by."
394,1662202,1665580,"We could have a watcher
on any house in any street."
395,1665664,1668416,"-It could be anybody.
-I don't think it's just anybody."
396,1668500,1670543,I think it's someone on our street.
397,1671294,1673630,Someone we are not tracking.

and secure neighborhood."
412,1721177,1723847,"We have great police,
as you learned yesterday."
413,1724514,1727559,"-Nothing bad is gonna happen to you. Okay?
-Dad."
