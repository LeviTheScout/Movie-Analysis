if it isn't Yuta Okkotsu,"
3,56056,57859,my favorite weakling.
4,57992,60060,[Yuta] Don't you come near me.
5,60193,63196,"Oh, come on, don't
play hard to get."
6,64766,66400,[Yuta] I said don't.
7,66534,70572,"I just wanna slug you one
more time before I graduate."

9,72172,75309,"You're not gonna deny me my
graduation present, are you?"
10,75442,78445,"Since it's our
last time together."
11,78580,80882,Maybe I should just kill you.
12,81015,82082,Don't touch me.
13,82215,83150,Rika.

and a secret execution?"
27,129931,131599,"Boy, that's some story."
28,132767,135770,"[Director] The child in
question did consent, though."
29,135903,137105,He's underage.
30,137237,138973,Just 16-years-old.
31,139107,142610,"And who knows how many he's
cursed to death so far."
32,142744,144378,He's already turned the tables
33,144512,148549,"on three grade-two sorcerers
and a grade-one sorcerer."
34,149684,152620,"Which is exactly the
reason you've turned to me,"
35,154421,156658,or have you forgotten that?
36,156791,157525,(director grunts)
37,157659,159192,"[Director] So, you'll take him?"
38,159326,160695,Yes.
39,160828,164866,"Yuta Okkotsu, will
attend Jujutsu High School."
40,168670,172305,"You make this in shop
class, Yuta Okkotsu?"
41,174008,176243,[Yuta] It used to be a knife.
42,178012,183417,"I tried killing myself
but Rika wouldn't let me."
43,185987,186888,Kinda dark.
44,188188,189857,(metal clanging)
45,189991,191224,Guess what?
46,191358,193161,"You're starting at
a new school today."
47,193293,194696,I'm not going.
48,194829,195830,Hmm.
49,197932,201169,"[Yuta] I don't want to
hurt anyone anymore,"
50,201301,203236,"so I'm never going
outside again."
51,204872,206507,Never?
52,206641,208910,"You're gonna get
pretty lonely that way."
53,211813,213715,"The curse that was
placed upon you."
54,213848,216416,"It's a curse that
can save people, too,"
55,216551,218886,"depending on how
it's used, of course."
56,220154,223524,"My advice to you is learn
how to use that power."
57,223658,226961,"You can cast it all away
later if you still decide to."

107,487688,490791,"Don't you know that
you are cursed?"

learn about curses."

to be hanging around."

die mysterious deaths"

actually not accidents,"

can affect other curses."

away pretty quickly."

140,578345,580014,Thank you.
141,580147,581082,Can I open it?
142,581215,582083,[Rika] Go ahead.
143,582216,583084,(Yuta chuckles)
144,583217,583951,Really?
145,584085,586787,"[Rika] Yes, I said go ahead."
146,591092,591759,Huh?
147,591892,593060,It's a ring.
148,593694,595729,[Rika] An engagement ring.

when we grow up,"

call an ambulance."

call the coroner."
158,626427,628662,"(woman sighs) There's no
way she's gonna make it."
159,628796,629763,[Man] What happened?
160,629897,631499,[Woman] Her head's crushed in.
161,631632,632900,[Man] How horrible.
162,633033,634768,"[Man] Yes, a child
got run over by a car."
163,634902,636538,"I don't know, hurry."
164,636670,638038,[Man] We should help her.
165,638172,639508,[Woman] I'm not going near that.
166,639640,640774,[Man] That poor girl.
167,640908,642176,"[Woman] Oh, this
is heartbreaking."

169,645279,646380,[Rika] Yuta.
170,648315,650317,(Yuta groans)
171,650451,653254,(suspenseful music)
172,655823,657024,Yuta.
173,659927,662363,"When we grow up,"
174,662663,666967,we're gonna get married.
175,667268,671372,"- (suspenseful music)
- (Yuta groans)"
176,671506,672740,It's a promise.
177,672873,674141,"So, as you can see,"
178,674275,675976,"this boy was cursed
by his friend Rika,"
179,676110,678279,"who is still madly
in love with him."
180,678412,683817,"Be nice to him or else
Rika will get you."
181,684451,685486,(Panda groans)
182,685620,687054,"Remember, if you attack Yuta,"
183,687188,690224,"Rika's curse will activate
or maybe it won't."
184,690357,691425,It's hard to say.
185,691560,694228,"So be careful, everyone."
186,694361,695829,Now he tells us.
187,695963,698299,"Since these students
are acting all cool."
188,698432,700635,"Let me introduce them
to you real quick-like."
189,700768,703204,"[Yuta] I have a feeling
this teacher's the problem,"
190,703337,704606,not the students.
191,704738,707208,"[Satoru] This is the cursed
tool user, Maki Zen'in."
192,707341,710177,"She uses special tools
to exorcize curses."
193,711345,713847,"This is the cursed speech
user, Toge Inumaki."
194,713981,715783,"He can only speak in
rice ball ingredients,"
195,715916,717318,so have fun chatting.
196,717451,718319,[Toge] Kelp.
197,718452,719320,[Satoru] And Panda.
198,719453,720387,"Hi, I'm Panda."
199,720522,722056,It's nice to meet you.
200,722189,725025,"Okay, you're all set."
201,725159,728229,"[Yuta] But I'm still not
sure what I'm doing here."
202,728362,729531,"All right then,"
203,729664,732800,"our first year class is
a solid four students."
204,732933,735704,"[Yuta] Three students
and one animal anyway."
205,735836,738205,"For your afternoon
jujutsu practice,"
206,738339,740474,"you'll be in pairs
of two on two."
207,740609,742644,"Toge and Panda, you're one pair."
208,742776,744144,All right.
209,744278,746413,"[Satoru] And Maki,
you're with Yuta."
210,746548,747748,DOE.
211,747881,749817,Did she just say DOE?
212,749950,752920,(birds chirping)
213,755489,759527,"Hey, I really hope
we can work together."
214,761929,764999,"You were bullied,
I can totally tell."
215,765132,767268,(lightning crashes)
216,767401,769236,(Yuta groans)
217,769370,771772,"I take it by that lame
reaction, I'm right."
218,771905,774475,"I totally get it,
I'd bully you too."
219,774609,775744,(Yuta groans)
220,775876,777344,"Maybe it's because
you're cursed?"
221,777478,779581,"It's written on your face
that you're trying to come off"
222,779714,780582,as a goody-two-shoes.
223,780715,781750,It's sickening.
224,781882,783050,(Yuta gasps)
225,783183,784318,"Why are you acting
like the victim"
226,784451,786253,"when you're the one
being protected?"
227,786387,788856,"I bet, you've been
passive your whole life."
228,788989,790291,(Yuta groans)
229,790424,792727,"Believe me, Jujutsu High
isn't gonna be that easy."
230,793427,795963,"You're gonna have to step
up if you wanna make it."
231,796096,797498,(Yuta groans)
232,797632,798533,Maki.
233,798667,800467,That's enough of that.
234,800602,801569,[Toge] Bonito flakes.
235,802570,804305,"Okay, fine."
236,804438,805540,Get off my case.
237,806608,808042,Sorry about her.
238,808175,809810,"She has a bad habit of
thinking she's an authority"
239,809943,811145,on mind-reading.
240,811845,814582,"No, she's right."
241,820087,821455,(footsteps tapping)
242,821589,822856,Where are we?
243,822990,824526,"[Satoru] It's just
an elementary school."
244,824659,825859,[Yuta] Huh?
245,825993,827828,"Or rather, just an
elementary school"
246,827961,829830,"where some children
have gone missing."
247,829963,831332,Gone missing?
248,831465,833601,"[Satoru] It happens a
lot in places like this."
249,833735,837071,"It's probably the work of a
naturally-occurring curse."
250,837971,839440,(Yuta gulps)
251,839574,841643,"Are you saying a curse
actually kidnapped some kids?"
252,841776,844445,"Yup, two kids so far."
253,844579,847448,"Curses tend to settle
in spots like these."
254,847582,850317,"Places where bad
memories occurred."
255,851586,853688,"Schools, hospitals."
256,853822,855189,Places often remembered
257,855322,858660,"with negative emotions are
a receptacle for curses."
258,858793,860094,"As those emotions build up,"
259,860227,862463,"they can cause a
curse to be born."
260,862597,863598,Like it was here.
261,864699,867000,"We're here to exorcize the
curse, and save the kids"
262,867134,869002,"Or retrieve them
if they're dead."
263,869136,870538,(Yuta groans)
264,870672,871539,Dead?
265,873374,876210,"Emerge from darkness
blacker still."
266,876343,878847,Purify that which is impure.
267,878979,882383,(veil crackling)
268,882517,883484,Huh?
269,883618,885653,It's turning into night.
270,886987,888389,It's a veil.
271,888523,891191,"A barrier of sorts to
help smoke out the curses."
272,891325,893595,"It also keeps us hidden
from the outside."
273,895329,898031,"It's pretty easy to
undo from inside."
274,900702,902403,"Do be careful now, you two."
275,903571,904572,Try not to die.
276,905640,907542,Die? Gojo?
277,907675,908543,[Maki] Transfer student.
278,908676,909677,Huh?
279,910477,912547,"Don't let yourself
get distracted."
280,912680,915683,(suspenseful music)
281,917752,918620,Put
282,919420,920421,me
283,921088,922289,On!
284,923023,925527,(Yuta groans)
285,926728,927595,Put me on.
286,929930,931833,[Yuta] They're coming this way.
287,931965,932901,What do we do?
288,933033,934602,Stop screaming.
289,934736,937004,(air whooshing)
290,937137,938439,(suspenseful music)
291,938573,941810,"Just remember this,
the weaker curses are,"
292,941942,943578,the more they group together.
293,944579,947414,(stick whooshing)
294,949383,952986,"Of course, the same could
be said for human beings."
295,953120,954421,[Yuta] Incredible.
296,954556,956591,"She wiped them all out
with a single blow."
297,958392,960093,"Okay, let's get a move on."
298,960227,961295,[Yuta] Huh?
299,961428,962630,Where to?
300,962764,964566,"Inside, obviously."
301,967100,970538,(Yuta breathes deeply)
302,974742,976310,"Miss Zen'in, aren't you"
303,976443,978613,"at least a little bit
scared of this place?"
304,978746,980314,Don't use my last name.
305,981148,982550,Sorry.
306,982684,985219,"It's just, this place is
really giving me the creeps."
307,985352,988388,"It's exactly the type of
place where ghosts would be."
308,988523,989958,"[Maki] There aren't
many curses here,"
309,990090,991992,"even though the
veil's been drawn."
310,993126,995663,"No, they are here,"
311,995797,997464,they're just not attacking.
312,998432,1001301,"I wonder, is it
because he's here?"
313,1001636,1002302,(Yuta groans)
314,1002436,1003671,Something just moved.
315,1003805,1004706,[Maki] Hey?
316,1004839,1005807,[Yuta] What?
317,1005940,1007542,[Maki] What grade are you?
318,1008475,1010043,[Yuta] Like in school?
319,1010177,1013615,"Jujutsu sorcerers are ranked
in grades from four to one."
320,1013748,1015148,"Yeah, but, I only started"
321,1015282,1017752,"at Jujutsu High
School this week."
322,1017886,1019654,I don't think I'm ranked yet.
323,1019787,1020655,(Maki grunts)
324,1020788,1022155,Forget it.
325,1022289,1023691,Show me your student ID.
326,1023825,1026594,"The one you got from that
dumb blindfolded guy."
327,1027461,1029062,Dumb blindfolded guy?
328,1030698,1032366,"Okay, here you go."
329,1032499,1036638,"Well, if you just joined,
you're probably a grade four."
330,1036771,1037705,Special-grade?
331,1038940,1042409,"Special-grade is even a
higher ranking than Grade One,"
332,1042544,1045947,"This must be some kind of a
practical joke or something."
333,1046079,1046948,Miss Zen'in.
334,1047080,1047949,Miss Zen'in.
335,1048081,1049249,Behind you.
336,1049851,1052252,(monster crackling)
337,1052386,1055055,"- (ground rumbles)
- (Yuta groans)"
338,1055188,1057725,(explosion booms)
339,1057859,1060862,(monster growls)
340,1060995,1061896,(monster growls)
341,1062030,1063631,(Yuta screams)
342,1063765,1065198,[Maki] Shit.
343,1065332,1066768,You're way too damn big.
344,1068036,1069971,(Maki shouts)
345,1070103,1072306,(monster growls)
346,1072439,1075977,"- (metal clangs)
- (Maki grunts)"
347,1076109,1077411,(monster gulps)
348,1077545,1078513,Yum.
349,1079047,1080682,(monster burps)
350,1080815,1082750,Thank you for the meal.
351,1085620,1086486,(foot thuds)
352,1086621,1087287,Shit.
353,1087421,1088890,I dropped my cursed tool.
354,1089023,1090792,Let us out of here.
355,1094194,1095495,Where are we now?
356,1095630,1097799,"We're stuck in this
dumb curse's stomach."
357,1097932,1100535,"No reason to go
passing out over this."
358,1100668,1102604,You mean that curse ate us?
359,1102737,1105272,"That's right. And I thought you
were supposed to be protected"
360,1105405,1106908,by that curse of yours?
361,1107041,1108342,"[Yuta] Don't blame me,"
362,1108475,1110578,"I have no idea what makes
Rika decide to come out."
363,1110712,1112479,But what are we gonna do now?
364,1112614,1114448,"After a while the
veil will go away,"
365,1114582,1116149,and help will come for us.
366,1116283,1117150,(Maki grunts)
367,1117284,1118452,Embarrassing.
368,1118586,1119721,Shit.
369,1119854,1120989,[Boy] Please help.
370,1121121,1121990,Hmm?
371,1122122,1122991,Who's there?
372,1123123,1124092,"Please help me,"
373,1124224,1125893,my friend's about to die.
374,1127061,1128830,(Yuta groans)
375,1128963,1130397,(Yuta gulps)
376,1130531,1133101,"Are you saying a curse
actually kidnapped some kid?"
377,1133233,1135435,"Yup, two kids so far."
378,1135570,1138338,"We're here to exorcize the
curse, and save the kids"
379,1138472,1140307,"or retrieve them
if they're dead."
380,1140975,1142275,Thank goodness.
381,1142409,1143578,They're alive.
382,1143711,1144812,Just barely.
383,1144946,1145813,Huh?
384,1145947,1146814,Look at them closer.
385,1147815,1151451,"The big one's obviously been
affected by the curse, too."
386,1151586,1153721,"Both of them could
die at any minute."
387,1155089,1155957,"Oh, no."
388,1156090,1156958,(Yuta groans)
389,1157091,1157959,What do we do?
390,1158092,1159459,I told you.
391,1159594,1161796,All we can do is wait for help.
392,1161929,1163463,Not everyone's like you.
393,1163598,1166400,"Most people don't have
resistance to curses."
394,1167300,1168168,Huh?
395,1168301,1169469,Miss Zen'in?
396,1170038,1171673,(Maki groans)
397,1171806,1172807,Maki.
398,1175009,1175943,(Yuta gasps)
399,1176077,1177812,What kind of wound is this?
400,1179614,1182315,"Does this mean
you're cursed now?"
401,1182449,1184886,Is she going to die?
402,1187220,1189824,"Please, I don't want to die too."
403,1190958,1192259,(boy cries)
404,1192392,1193594,Please.
405,1194629,1196531,I don't know how to save you.
406,1197699,1198566,I'm sorry.
407,1198700,1199801,Okkotsu.
408,1199934,1204072,"Tell me, why did you
come to Jujutsu High?"
409,1204204,1205807,What is it you wanna do?
410,1208009,1208876,What do you want?
411,1209010,1209944,What're your goals?
412,1210078,1211846,What are you trying to achieve?
413,1212814,1217151,"I just don't wanna see
anyone getting hurt again."
414,1218119,1221689,"I tried to lock myself
away and disappear."
415,1222690,1226027,"But Gojo warned me
I'd be too lonely."
416,1226160,1227862,And I couldn't argue with him.
417,1229697,1232133,I don't want to be all alone.
418,1232265,1234936,I want to be needed by someone.
419,1235069,1238906,"I want it to be all right
to know that I'm alive."
420,1241542,1242844,"Fine, do it then."
421,1244879,1247949,"Keep exorcizing curses
over and over again."
422,1248816,1250585,"And when you get good at it,"
423,1250718,1252954,"confidence and
friends will find you."
424,1254354,1259560,"That's why we're
here at Jujutsu High."
425,1259927,1262029,(gentle music)
426,1268970,1271139,(metal clangs)
427,1271271,1272472,Rika.
428,1273608,1274809,"[Rika] Yes, Yuta?"
429,1276844,1279279,[Yuta] Lend me your strength.
430,1279412,1281983,(metal dings)
431,1282116,1284919,(monster groans)
432,1288321,1291692,(Rika screams)
433,1291826,1292827,Who are you?
434,1292960,1293961,Who are you?
435,1295096,1297598,(Rika grunts)
436,1302804,1306007,[Rika] That's enough out of you.
437,1308009,1308876,(blood splashes)
438,1309010,1310377,Now that's terrifying.
439,1311444,1313681,Rika Orimoto at her strongest.
440,1313815,1315917,Impressive special-grade curse.
441,1317051,1318152,(Satoru giggles)
442,1318286,1319520,So scary.
443,1320888,1321889,"Oh, wow."
444,1322523,1323724,Look at me.
445,1324491,1325860,I'm so pretty.
446,1327427,1329462,I love it.
447,1330998,1333701,(Yuta groans)
448,1339173,1340373,All right.
449,1340508,1342810,"It's just a little
further everybody."
450,1343845,1347114,"I need to get Miss Zen'in
and these kids to Gojo."
451,1347248,1350885,"Hopefully, Rika keeps
those curses distracted."
452,1351018,1353521,(Yuta groans)
453,1355189,1357892,(Yuta grunts)
454,1360027,1361963,I can't stop.
455,1363396,1364999,Not yet.
456,1365132,1367835,(Yuta grunts)
457,1369402,1372006,I'm not gonna be weak anymore.
458,1372139,1373507,I'm gonna change.
459,1373641,1374842,Here and now.
460,1377377,1381148,"[Rika] Yuta, you can do it."
461,1386087,1387154,"Yes, I can."
462,1388089,1390892,(gentle music)
463,1392660,1393861,Welcome back.
464,1395162,1396163,You did well.
465,1403470,1406741,"They say both Maki and the
kids are going to be fine."
466,1407708,1409043,That's a relief.
467,1410011,1412546,"Funny, you don't look
very relieved to me."
468,1414248,1415650,I did it.
469,1415783,1418319,"I managed to call
Rika out by myself."
470,1418451,1419620,"Oh, really?"
471,1419754,1421856,That's a big step forward.
472,1421989,1424225,(wheels creaking)
473,1424358,1427061,(Yuta groans)
474,1429263,1431999,(gentle music)
475,1435102,1437972,(Yuta coughing)
476,1466400,1468769,"[Yuta] Okay, I'm gonna spin you."
477,1468903,1471138,(Rika and Yuta giggles)
478,1471272,1472940,"Stop, Yuta."
479,1473074,1476711,"I said stop, you're
gonna make me fall."
480,1476844,1478980,(Rika and Yuta giggles)
481,1479113,1480448,"- [Yuta] Rika, you got me.
- [Rika] There."
482,1480581,1481849,"- Take that.
- (Rika and Yuta giggles)"
483,1481983,1483384,[Yuta] You better watch out.
484,1483517,1487021,(Rika and Yuta giggles)
485,1492393,1495262,"[Rika] It's a promise
that when we both grow up,"
486,1495396,1497865,"we're going to get
married to each other."
487,1499166,1500368,Okay.
488,1500501,1503204,(Rika groans)
489,1505006,1508542,"We'll be together,
forever and ever."
490,1509443,1510644,All the time.
491,1513314,1514849,[Satoru] You okay?
492,1516217,1517151,Yeah.
493,1517284,1520154,"I was just
remembering something."
494,1521222,1524959,"I'm starting to think Rika
didn't curse me after all."
495,1525092,1528162,"I think I might have been
the one who cursed Rika."
496,1530831,1532666,You very well may be right.
497,1532800,1535504,"There's no curse more
twisted than love."
498,1535636,1538272,(Yuta cries)
499,1542843,1545880,"All right, while
I'm at Jujutsu High,"
500,1546013,1548883,"there's something
I want to learn."
501,1549016,1551152,I want to break Rika's curse.
502,1557391,1558192,(ambulance siren wailing)
503,1558325,1561028,(door creaks)
504,1562263,1565266,(footsteps tapping)
505,1571839,1574041,"[Director] The special-grade
cursed apparition,"
506,1574175,1578979,"Rika Orimoto was fully
manifested for 442 seconds."
507,1579346,1582049,"We entrusted you with
Yuta Okkotsu precisely"
508,1582183,1584985,"so we could prevent
this sort of thing."
509,1585119,1587321,"There's no room
for excuses, Gojo."
510,1587455,1590791,"Well, that's good, because
I don't have any excuses."
511,1590925,1592927,"[Director] How can
you joke about this?"
512,1593060,1595830,"If Rika Orimoto had
remained out of control,"
513,1595963,1598365,"she could have wiped
out an entire town."
514,1598499,1601635,"If she had I would have
risked my life to stop her."
515,1601769,1603737,"Listen, now that we've seen it,"
516,1603871,1606740,"there's only one thing we
can say about that curse."
517,1606874,1609343,And that's I don't understand.
518,1609477,1610778,Why did a little girl
519,1610911,1613214,"who wasn't from any line
of jujutsu sorcerers,"
520,1613347,1616050,"become such an immense
and powerful curse?"
521,1616183,1620020,"We can't control something
that we don't understand."
522,1621021,1622957,"So, it's just gonna
take trial and error."
523,1623090,1626026,"Leave it alone for a while,
and see how it works out."
524,1626160,1628963,"[Director] Do not forget,
Yuta Okkotsu's execution"
525,1629096,1631533,"has only been
temporarily suspended."
526,1631665,1633200,And don't you forget
527,1634201,1636971,"that if it comes down
to that decision,"
528,1637104,1639173,I'll side with Yuta Okkotsu.
529,1640641,1642643,(footsteps tapping)
530,1642776,1644178,Damn.
531,1644311,1646615,"Those school directors
are such rude old geezers."
532,1646747,1648883,"I don't ever wanna
become like them."
533,1649016,1651785,"I'll have to be careful
that I never do."
534,1651919,1653154,Don't they get it?
535,1653287,1655524,"No one should be allowed
to take youth away"
536,1655656,1656857,from young people.
537,1659293,1662163,(Yuta groaning)
538,1664832,1667301,"Maki and Toge,
it's your last lap."
539,1668302,1670171,(Yuta groaning)
540,1670304,1672306,"No one will take
their youth away."
541,1679648,1682816,(door clicks)
542,1682950,1684385,"Go in, after you."
543,1684519,1685386,(Yuta groans)
544,1685520,1686387,Okay.
545,1691892,1694328,(Yuta gasps)
546,1698432,1700935,"It's nearly impossible
to exorcize a curse"
547,1701068,1703170,as big as Rika Orimoto.
548,1703304,1706340,"However, breaking the
curse is a different story."
549,1706473,1709910,"You have to identify thousands
of knots of cursed energy,"
550,1710044,1712246,and unravel them one by one.
551,1713047,1715149,"It's a method that can
only be pursued by you,"
552,1715282,1717184,the person that she's cursed.
553,1717318,1719353,"What exactly am
I supposed to do?"
554,1719486,1720888,"Here, use this."
555,1721021,1721855,(sword whooshes)
556,1721989,1723390,(Yuta groans)
557,1723525,1725594,"Whoa, a katana?"
558,1725726,1727228,"You see, curses are most stable"
559,1727361,1729263,"when they're
possessing an object."
560,1730064,1731432,"If you remember,
back at that school,"
561,1731566,1734201,"you used that ring
to connect to Rika."
562,1734335,1736270,The pipeline's already there.
563,1736403,1738906,"So now you need to borrow
part of Rika's curse,"
564,1739039,1741775,"imbue it into the
katana, and control it."
565,1741909,1743877,"Increase the amount
as you repeat it,"
566,1744011,1745746,"and eventually you'll
have the whole curse"
567,1745879,1747248,under your control.
568,1747381,1749383,"Once you do that,
then you're free."
569,1751018,1753420,Both you and her.
570,1754955,1757324,Imbue the curse into the katana.
571,1757458,1759126,But that's not all.
572,1759260,1761696,"You also have to learn
how to wield a blade."
573,1762396,1764465,"Until you can combine
those two skills,"
574,1764599,1766133,you'll still be weak.
575,1766267,1769303,"So the first thing we're gonna
do is to get you training."
576,1773807,1776410,(upbeat music)
577,1789490,1790659,(Yuta grunts)
578,1790791,1795462,"- (Maki and Yuta grunting)

581,1802303,1807509,"- (Maki and Yuta grunting)
- (sword stick thudding)"
582,1820487,1821822,What's up?
583,1821955,1823658,How's it going?
584,1823792,1824858,"Oh, It's going."
585,1824992,1826126,(Yuta grunts)
586,1826260,1828128,"Don't get distracted, newbie."
587,1828996,1830264,"Yeah, right."
588,1830397,1832366,"[Maki] Don't just stand
there, take your stance."
589,1832499,1833467,Idiot.
590,1833601,1834602,Sorry.
591,1835436,1837971,"Are you gonna land a
blow sometime today?"
592,1839808,1841308,"Yeah, right now."
593,1842476,1844546,(upbeat music)
594,1844679,1850050,"- (Maki and Yuta grunting)
- (sword stick thudding)"
595,1856890,1858258,She dodged that?
596,1858959,1860528,But now she's off-balance.
597,1860662,1862162,I'll get her on the landing.
598,1863665,1864498,(stick whooshes)
599,1864632,1865933,No way.
600,1866066,1869069,(Maki and Yuta grunting)

- (stick thuds)"
602,1870204,1871506,"Congrats, you're dead."
603,1872473,1874241,"I win again, and
remain undefeated."
604,1874375,1876511,Was that last part necessary?
605,1876644,1878045,Don't be so soft.
606,1878178,1880849,"You should always treat training
like it's a real battle."
607,1880981,1882584,"Both experiencing
pain and avoiding pain"
608,1882717,1885352,"makes a huge difference
in how fast you grow."
609,1886621,1889923,"She's right, I gotta
get back in there."
610,1890759,1891959,"One more, please."
611,1892761,1894194,I have to get better.
612,1895362,1898932,"If I don't improve, I'll
never break Rika's curse."
613,1900234,1902202,"- (Maki and Yuta grunting)

614,1902336,1905339,"It's been three months since
Yuta came to Jujutsu High."
615,1905472,1907876,"His movements are
getting better every day."
616,1908008,1909309,[Toge] Salmon.
617,1909443,1911579,"Even his personality
is more positive now."
618,1911713,1913013,[Toge] Salmon roe.
619,1913147,1915315,"And Maki looks like she's
having more fun too."
620,1915449,1918686,"I don't think she got to spar
very often with other weapon."
621,1919721,1920588,(Panda gasps)
622,1920722,1922791,I've had a revelation.
623,1922923,1924526,"Hey, Yuta."
624,1924659,1925527,Come here.
625,1925660,1926795,Come over here.
626,1926927,1928596,Huh?
627,1928730,1930097,"What's up, Panda?"
628,1930230,1931833,"We have to have a super
important discussion,"
629,1931965,1933535,so listen close.
630,1933668,1936937,"What do you like better,
big or small boobs?"
631,1937070,1938573,What?
632,1938706,1939973,"To tell you the truth,"
633,1940107,1940941,"I've never given it
much thought before."
634,1941074,1942744,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
635,1943277,1945580,"I guess given the choice
I like them somewhat big?"
636,1945713,1947615,"Oh, really?"
637,1947749,1949517,Maki.
638,1949651,1950552,Huh?
639,1950685,1952620,You have a shot.
640,1952754,1955088,"Shot, shot, shot."
641,1956423,1957759,"[Maki] What crazy
ideas are you getting"
642,1957892,1958760,in that head of yours?
643,1958893,1960194,[Panda] Don't be so shy.
644,1960327,1962095,"It's not like you're
in elementary school."
645,1962229,1963430,"[Maki] Oh, that's it."
646,1963565,1965065,"- I'm gonna kill you.
- (Yuta giggles)"
647,1965199,1965999,"- What're they fighting about?
- [Panda] Ow, ow."
648,1966133,1967334,[Toge] Kelp.
649,1968636,1971606,(Yuta giggles)
650,1971739,1975342,"[Yuta] I still don't understand
anything Inumaki says."
651,1975476,1977946,"Which makes me a
little scared of him."
652,1978078,1978947,(Gojo claps)
653,1979079,1981783,"Okay, gather round."
654,1981916,1985653,"You two continue training or
whatever it is you're doing."
655,1986588,1988590,"Toge, you've been
requested for a curse"
656,1988723,1989958,that you're perfect for.
657,1990090,1991726,"Shouldn't take you
long to exorcize it."
658,1991860,1992727,[Toge] Salmon.
659,1992861,1994394,Requested?
660,1994529,1996598,"Toge is the only grade-two
sorcerer among us first-years."
661,1996731,1999366,"He's allowed to take on
missions all on his own."
662,1999501,2000702,(Panda and Maki grunts)
663,2000835,2002035,"Wow, that's impressive."
664,2002169,2003270,"[Maki] Your
special-grade's higher."
665,2003403,2005138,"Yuta, why don't
you go along too."
666,2005272,2006808,You'll be Toge's support.
667,2006941,2007876,Huh?
668,2008008,2009476,You want me to support him?
669,2009611,2012312,"[Satoru] Well, you'll be more
like an observer, really."
670,2012446,2014481,"There's a wide
variety of jujutsu,"
671,2014616,2016450,"so you can assume
there are as many ways"
672,2016584,2019386,"to exorcize a curse as
there are sorcerers."
673,2019521,2022155,"Toge's cursed speech is a
good example of one way."
674,2022289,2023758,Make sure to learn from him.
675,2023892,2025392,Cursed speech?
676,2025527,2028161,"As the term suggests, it's
imbuing speech with curses."
677,2028295,2030865,"Eh, it'll make sense
once you see it."
678,2030999,2034536,"To break a curse, you must
first understand curses."
679,2035904,2037772,[Yuta] My first real mission.
680,2037906,2039874,"No, wait, my second."
681,2040008,2042175,"Oh, I'm still so nervous."
682,2043678,2044679,[Toge] Salmon.
683,2044812,2046113,(Yuta groans)
684,2046246,2047114,"Oh, I."
685,2047247,2048115,You startled me.
686,2048248,2049449,Sorry.
687,2050217,2052687,"Yuta, one more thing."
688,2052820,2053755,Coming.
689,2053888,2055289,"Sorry, but I don't have the time"
690,2055422,2056991,to supervise this mission.
691,2057124,2060562,"But this job is typically one
Toge could handle by himself."
692,2060695,2061996,So you can relax.
693,2062129,2064732,"There's only one thing that
you need to be careful of."
694,2066000,2067535,Don't let Rika out.
695,2068836,2070705,"There's no guarantee
she'll go back in,"
696,2070838,2072205,like she did last time.
697,2072339,2074042,"Only use the portion
of Rika's power"
698,2074174,2076076,"that you can imbue
in your sword."
699,2077545,2080882,"Do you know what will happen
if you let her out again?"
700,2081015,2081916,"No, what happens?"
701,2082050,2084719,"Bluh, both you and me."
702,2084852,2086386,Dead as a door nail.
703,2086521,2087722,I'm counting on you.
704,2087855,2089958,(Yuta groans)
705,2090090,2093160,"[Yuta] Why does he have to
bring that up right now?"
706,2099033,2101569,(crows caw)
707,2104539,2107842,(car engine revving)
708,2110745,2111746,We've arrived.
709,2113815,2115349,Hapina Shopping District.
710,2115482,2118620,"At the moment, most of the
stores are closed to the public."
711,2119687,2122824,"""There's a project to demolish
the Hapina Shopping District"
712,2122957,2124592,in order to put up a new mall.
713,2124726,2126561,"During an inspection
of the area,"
714,2126694,2128796,"we confirmed a pack
of low-level curses"
715,2128930,2130798,hiding among the corridors.
716,2132066,2133333,"In order to exorcize them,"
717,2133467,2136203,"we request, grade-two
sorcerer, Toge."""
718,2136336,2137672,"Huh, wait."
719,2137805,2139339,Where did Toge go?
720,2139473,2140407,He was right here.
721,2140541,2141809,"[Man] Thank you, come again."
722,2141943,2144277,"Oh, Mr. Ijichi, over there."
723,2146246,2148049,He was shopping?
724,2148181,2149917,What did you buy in that store?
725,2152687,2153821,Throat medicine?
726,2154889,2156189,(Ijichi sighs)
727,2156323,2157959,"In short, they want
us to exorcize it now"
728,2158092,2160662,"before the building they're
spending so much money on"
729,2160795,2163163,"develops a reputation
for cursed energy."
730,2163296,2164699,[Toge] Salmon.
731,2164832,2165867,Now then.
732,2166000,2167401,I will draw the veil.
733,2168368,2169570,Good luck to you.
734,2174642,2177879,(Yuta breathes deeply)
735,2180715,2183985,"He said, it was a pack
of low-level curses."

738,2202770,2205006,"[Fish Curse] That's
not fair, Mama."
739,2205139,2207909,My brother got more than I did.
740,2208042,2209309,[Fish Curse] So what?
741,2209443,2211179,"Let's trade doubles that
way we both get one."
742,2211311,2214782,(fish curse chattering)
743,2218653,2220722,"[Fish Curse] Is
the cheapest stuff."
744,2221656,2223290,"[Maki] The weaker curses are,"
745,2223423,2225026,the more they group together.
746,2225159,2226694,Look at them all.
747,2226828,2228930,"Weak or not, there's
just too many."
748,2234068,2235268,Huh?
749,2235402,2236604,Inumaki?
750,2237205,2238072,It's dangerous.
751,2238206,2239807,Don't get too close.
752,2239941,2240942,Explode.
753,2243578,2246614,(explosion booms)
754,2248116,2249249,"Oh, wow."
755,2249382,2251886,So this is cursed speech?
756,2252019,2252887,Huh?
757,2253020,2254856,"Oh, it's over already?"

761,2260194,2261294,Wait.
762,2261428,2263430,"That explains the
throat medicine."
763,2264832,2267201,"What an incredible
amount of power."
764,2267334,2270605,"But I'm sure it comes with
a great deal of risk, too."
765,2273074,2274341,[Toge] Bonito flakes.
766,2274474,2275710,Is something wrong?
767,2276644,2279881,"Oh, yeah, the veil
isn't lifting."
768,2280014,2282750,"Hmm, I can't get through."
769,2282884,2285418,"Does this mean,
there's no way out?"

from the others."

784,2326527,2328629,"They said the curses
were low-level,"
785,2328763,2330665,but that thing is enormous.
786,2330798,2332499,This isn't what we were told.

than the big guys"
788,2335803,2337839,from the elementary school.

793,2344444,2345313,Whoa.
794,2345445,2346379,Twisted.

it, it might get worse."

looking for us at all."
801,2368336,2370805,I'll contact Mr. Ijichi.
802,2370938,2371606,Huh?
803,2371739,2373074,Out of service?
804,2373207,2374575,That can't be.
805,2374709,2376077,[Toge] Bonito flakes.
806,2376210,2377078,Huh?
807,2377211,2378613,Because of the veil?
808,2380948,2384118,"Well, if the veil won't
lift, we have to exorcize it."
809,2384252,2385452,Isn't that right?

moving around already."
812,2395963,2397064,Salmon.
813,2397198,2398199,(Toge coughs)
814,2398332,2399533,Huh?
815,2400835,2403170,"You want to fight this
battle by yourself?"
816,2428162,2429997,"Thanks, Inumaki."
817,2430131,2431132,"But,"
818,2433701,2435503,I'm going to come with you.
819,2440141,2442143,(footsteps tapping)
820,2442276,2443476,We'll both do our best.
821,2443611,2444979,Let's go.
822,2445112,2448082,(suspenseful music)
823,2454088,2456590,(Zomba growls)
824,2457425,2460127,"[Rika] Go get him, Yuta."
825,2460261,2462763,(Zomba growl)
826,2464932,2466834,"Hey, what's it mad at me for?"
827,2466968,2469804,Like it wasn't scary enough.
828,2469937,2470938,Huh?
829,2472406,2475643,(Yuta breathes deeply)
830,2475776,2477511,Don't take your eyes off him.
831,2477645,2479447,Don't stop moving.
832,2479580,2481949,Imbue the curse into the katana.
833,2486287,2488022,(sword clanging)
834,2488155,2491192,(explosion booms)
835,2494595,2496330,(Yuta grunts)
836,2496464,2499100,(explosion booms)
837,2499233,2501802,"Inumaki has an
incredibly kind heart."
838,2501936,2503938,"He doesn't want to
accidentally curse others,"
839,2504071,2506474,"so he speaks in rice
ball ingredients,"
840,2506607,2508976,words that can't carry curses.
841,2509110,2510978,"Even today, he helped me out."
842,2511112,2513114,"He tried to keep me
away from danger."
843,2514415,2516717,"Earlier, when I was
totally freaking out,"
844,2516851,2519220,"he was trying to make
me feel comfortable."
845,2521222,2524258,(explosion booms)
846,2526327,2527161,(Zomba groans)
847,2527294,2529063,(sword whooshing)
848,2529196,2530498,(Zomba groans)
849,2530631,2532199,A superficial wound.
850,2532333,2533701,"Boy, he's tough."
851,2533834,2535903,"- (explosion booms)
- (Yuta grunts)"
852,2536037,2539240,"Okay, maybe I can't compete
with this curse but Inumaki can."
853,2541375,2544078,(suspenseful music)
854,2544211,2545346,"Inumaki, catch."
855,2545479,2547081,(throat medicine whooshes)
856,2547214,2550851,"I'm not gonna let Inumaki
kindness go to waste."
857,2551585,2552853,Nice catch.
858,2557691,2558559,(Toge gulps)
859,2558692,2559693,(Zomba groans)
860,2559827,2562596,(upbeat music)
861,2564265,2567268,(explosion booms)
862,2569570,2570905,Get crushed.
863,2574208,2576877,(blood splashes)
864,2578379,2579480,Incredible.
865,2579613,2580915,[Toge] Mustard leaf.
866,2583250,2584585,"[Yuta] Oh, I'm fine."
867,2584718,2585920,It's only a scratch.
868,2589156,2590157,[Toge] Salmon.
869,2592561,2594795,"Yeah, good work."
870,2598432,2600201,"Once I break Rika's curse,"
871,2600334,2602736,"I'm gonna be a
normal person again."
872,2603737,2606407,"I won't be able to stay
at Jujutsu High anymore,"
873,2606541,2610244,"but until then, I'm gonna
try to help as many people"
874,2610377,2611378,as I can.
875,2613280,2614215,(Yuta groans)
876,2614348,2616317,"We still can't
get out, can't we?"
877,2617451,2618886,What a shame.
878,2619019,2622256,"I came here just to see the
rumored curse named Rika."
879,2623290,2626961,"As a special-grade, I was
hoping to meet her soon."
880,2629430,2632099,"Perhaps, I should go
return this to him."
881,2640207,2642977,"Toge's been able to use cursed
speech since he was born."
882,2643110,2645412,"You can imagine when he
was just a little boy,"
883,2645547,2648617,"he struggled quite a bit with
his new cursed speech power."
884,2648749,2650985,"Sometimes he accidentally
cursed people"
885,2651118,2652486,that he didn't mean to.
886,2652621,2656090,"In fact, his situation was
pretty similar to yours."
887,2656223,2657825,"That's why he's been
worried about you"
888,2657958,2660361,"ever since the day you
transferred in here."
889,2661495,2665166,"It's easy to misunderstand
him, but he's a good guy."
890,2665866,2668936,"Try to be as kind to
him as he is to you."
891,2669470,2670337,"Mm, I will."
892,2670471,2671540,(Yuta grunts)
893,2671672,2672773,"Time to start our
morning training."
894,2672907,2673974,"- (Panda giggles)
- Okay, I'm coming."
895,2674108,2675809,"Panda, what are you laughing at?"
896,2675943,2677178,Something funny?
897,2677311,2678279,"[Panda] Well,"
898,2678412,2680314,"- not really, but.
- Hey, Maki, hold on."
899,2680447,2681682,Huh?
900,2681815,2683518,"Are there any cool
tricks you can teach me?"
901,2683652,2686887,"I'd like to imbue my curse
into my katana more smoothly."
902,2687021,2688155,Just forget it.
903,2688289,2690291,"Don't ask me about
cursed energy."
904,2694161,2695162,Hmm?
905,2697431,2700467,"After scouring every inch of
the Hapina Shopping District,"
906,2700602,2703170,"I found three different
types of residuals."
907,2703304,2704838,"Mr. Ijichi doesn't
think it's likely"
908,2704972,2706675,"we're going to find
anything more than that"
909,2706807,2707676,if we keep looking.
910,2707808,2709376,"Okay, got it, thanks."
911,2709511,2710579,Excellent report.
912,2710711,2711912,You bet.
913,2716016,2718886,(Satoru sniffs)
914,2722089,2725292,(suspenseful music)
915,2727662,2730864,(footsteps tapping)
916,2743477,2744478,Sorry to bother you.
917,2745246,2748382,"Our inspection showed, that
someone lowered a second veil"
918,2748516,2749718,on top of my own.
919,2749850,2751118,"We don't know who yet,"
920,2751252,2753287,"but we're analyzing
the residual energy."
921,2753420,2754689,"In addition,"
922,2754822,2757525,"a semi-first-grade curse made
an unexpected appearance."
923,2758826,2761895,"It's my fault for not being
as thorough as I should have."
924,2762029,2763397,I'll accept any punishment.
925,2763531,2764599,"No, you're fine."
926,2764733,2766767,You were just outclassed.
927,2766900,2768802,Outclassed by who?
928,2768936,2771438,"Do you have an idea
about who did it?"
929,2771573,2774775,(suspenseful music)
930,2786920,2788289,Suguru Geto.
931,2790424,2793160,"A special-grade
jujutsu sorcerer."
932,2793294,2795896,"One of four who was
banished from Jujutsu High."
933,2796531,2799933,"He cursed over a hundred
normal people to death."
934,2800067,2801468,The worst curse user ever.
935,2815316,2817585,"Mom, I'll be fine,
let's go home."
936,2817719,2820354,"We're already here, let's
just wait a little longer"
937,2820487,2821889,so we can meet him.
938,2822022,2822923,"But, Mom."
939,2823057,2823891,(door whooshes)
940,2824024,2826528,(both groans)
941,2838540,2839940,"Hello, Ladies."
942,2840074,2842510,"As I understand it, you said
your daughter was being haunted"
943,2842644,2843977,by a ghost.
944,2844111,2846347,"Isn't that right, Mrs. Sato?"
945,2846480,2850752,"Ah, yeah, but it's
Saito, actually."
946,2850884,2853153,"No, your name is Mrs. Sato."
947,2853287,2856423,"I've decided Sato is a
better name than Saito."
948,2857525,2859193,(mom groans)
949,2859326,2861195,"Come on, mom, let's just go."
950,2861328,2863897,"Sweetheart, let's get
this problem taken care of"
951,2864031,2865165,once and for all.
952,2865299,2866668,"This whole thing
seems shady, though."
953,2866801,2869903,"You constantly feel a
piercing gaze upon you."
954,2871038,2872473,"Sometimes your
shoulders feel heavy,"
955,2872607,2875175,"and it becomes
difficult to breathe."
956,2875309,2877512,"Almost as if you've
forgotten how."
957,2878780,2882517,"And you often dream that
you're being assaulted."
958,2884318,2885553,How did you know that?
959,2887756,2889390,Try not to move.
960,2889524,2892226,(monster groans)
961,2900000,2902403,"Wait, no way."
962,2902537,2903571,It feels better.
963,2906473,2909677,"Honestly, I don't know how
we could ever repay you."
964,2910779,2912079,Don't worry.
965,2912212,2914114,"We should all help
those in times of need."
966,2914248,2916785,"Come on by if you
have any more trouble."
967,2916917,2918085,(both giggles)
968,2918218,2919521,"See, I told you so."
969,2919654,2921989,"What this man has done
for you is simply godly."
970,2922122,2923323,Yeah.
971,2923858,2925325,"Godly, huh?"
972,2925459,2928395,"That Mrs. Sato is a
smart one, isn't she?"
973,2929296,2931999,"Filthy monkey who
can't even use jujutsu."
974,2932132,2934468,"Your true feelings seem
to be showing, Geto."
975,2934602,2936604,"The leaders are all
waiting for you."
976,2936738,2938138,They're in the meeting room.
977,2939306,2941676,"What is that stuff you're
spraying everywhere?"
978,2941810,2943444,Disinfecting deodorant.
979,2943578,2946614,"I don't want everyone to
breathe in the monkey smell."
980,2947882,2949584,What a great day.
981,2949717,2950819,I'm so happy.
982,2950951,2952554,"It's been so long
since we all met."
983,2952687,2954656,"I know, since all
the leaders are here,"
984,2954789,2956190,let's take a photo together.
985,2956323,2957191,Where's my camera?
986,2957324,2958526,Got it right here.
987,2958660,2960929,"- (camera shutter clicks)
- (Suda giggles)"
988,2961061,2962029,Geto.
989,2962162,2964566,I want to see Geto right now.
990,2964699,2965499,(Kanamori groans)
991,2965633,2967100,"Geto, damn you."
992,2967234,2968101,(Kanamori groans)
993,2968235,2969571,If it isn't Mr. Kanamori.
994,2969704,2972105,"What brings you here
in such a sweaty panic?"
995,2972239,2975275,"Don't play dumb, hurry
up and exorcize my curse."
996,2975409,2977946,"Do you know how much
I've paid you already?"
997,2978078,2978947,(Kanamori grunts)
998,2979079,2980047,How much?
999,2980180,2982216,Approximately 105 million yen.
1000,2982349,2985385,"However, no donations
for the past six months."
1001,2985520,2987655,"[Suguru] I guess
that's it for you then."
1002,2987789,2988656,Wait a minute.
1003,2988790,2991626,(Kanamori groans)
1004,2992794,2994027,"There are lots of monkeys,"
1005,2994161,2996463,"and they all have
their own role to play."
1006,2996598,2998700,"There are
money-collecting monkeys"
1007,2998833,3000969,and curse-collecting monkeys.
1008,3001101,3002837,You happen to be the former.
1009,3002971,3006240,"If you're out of money, I
have no further use for you."
1010,3007307,3008175,(Suguru gulps)
1011,3008308,3009176,(Suguru snaps)
1012,3009309,3011011,Screw you then.
1013,3011144,3014481,"[Monster] Suck, suck,
suck, suck, suck."
1014,3014616,3017417,"Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck."
1015,3018786,3020822,"Suck, suck, suck."
1016,3020955,3023691,(blood splashes)
1017,3025827,3027194,Totally disgusting.
1018,3027327,3029931,"I can't believe he's
part of the same species."
1019,3030063,3031633,"Now you know why
I'm always saying"
1020,3031766,3033801,"that they're
nothing but monkeys."
1021,3034636,3037437,"The time is here,
my beloved family."
1022,3037572,3039641,"Let's lower the curtain
on the age of monkeys,"
1023,3039774,3043545,"and build a paradise
for jujutsu sorcerers."
1024,3043678,3046179,"First though, we must
destroy the cornerstone"
1025,3046313,3049684,"of the jujutsu world,
Jujutsu High School."
1026,3051819,3052854,(Yuta groans)
1027,3052987,3054656,"[Panda] What's wrong, Yuta?"
1028,3054789,3055990,Well.
1029,3056123,3057859,"I think I just had
a bad premonition."
1030,3057992,3060127,"- You're imagining things.
- Yep, he's imagining things."
1031,3060260,3061729,[Toge] Bonito flakes.
1032,3061863,3062864,(Yuta groans)
1033,3062997,3064364,"[Yuta] Guys, wait up."
1034,3064498,3065800,"[Panda] I hate to
tell you, Yuta,"
1035,3065934,3068201,"but your ability to sense
cursed energy sucks."
1036,3068335,3069469,"[Maki] I figured it's dulled,"
1037,3069604,3070905,"with something like
Rika inside you."
1038,3071039,3072239,[Toge] Tuna.
1039,3073641,3076476,"We still aren't picking up
on any actions from Geto."
1040,3076611,3079547,"Are you sure you're not
worrying over him for nothing?"
1041,3079681,3082684,"Principal, it pains me to
tell you that's not possible."
1042,3082817,3085587,"I confirmed it
myself on the scene."
1043,3085720,3087487,"There's no way I would
mistake the residuals"
1044,3087622,3090257,of Suguru Geto's cursed energy.
1045,3090390,3092727,"Hmm, Suguru."
1046,3094261,3095429,God damn it.
1047,3095563,3097497,Speaking of that little devil.
1048,3097632,3101002,"Gather all sorcerers on campus,
semi-first-grade and above."
1049,3101134,3102870,"In the circle out
front, right now."
1050,3104038,3105405,That's unusual.
1051,3105540,3107709,"I guess Yuta was
right, after all."
1052,3107842,3108710,[Toge] Salmon.
1053,3108843,3109811,Huh?
1054,3110277,3113180,(wings whooshes)
1055,3117585,3120722,"Sorry bird brain but
you're in the wrong nest."
1056,3120855,3122657,"I haven't seen
that curse before."
1057,3122790,3123825,Salmon roe.
1058,3123958,3126426,"Wow, that's a real big bird."
1059,3126561,3129097,"This place never
does change, does it."
1060,3129229,3130397,Yuck.
1061,3130531,3131933,"Mr. Geto, please
don't tell me this is"
1062,3132066,3133166,what Tokyo looks like?
1063,3133300,3135103,"Feels like we're
out in the sticks."
1064,3135235,3136938,"Nanako, that's rude."
1065,3137071,3138171,What?
1066,3138305,3139641,"You know you think
so, too, Mimiko."
1067,3139774,3142110,"Come on, get out
of there already."
1068,3142242,3143778,Aren't you cold without a shirt?
1069,3143911,3145145,"Hey, who are those guys?"
1070,3145278,3147048,"Whoa, it's a panda."
1071,3147180,3148116,How cute.
1072,3148248,3149684,And who are you supposed to be?
1073,3149817,3152452,"Get off the school grounds
before Yuta makes you."
1074,3152587,3154354,"- Pollack roe.
- Huh?"
1075,3154488,3157491,"Better go home before you
get beat up, by Yuta, I mean."
1076,3157625,3158593,Huh?
1077,3159594,3161829,"[Suguru] Nice to meet
you, Yuta Okkotsu."
1078,3161963,3163598,My name is Suguru Geto.
1079,3163731,3165499,[Maki And Panda] He's fast.
1080,3166100,3166968,Hi.
1081,3167101,3168603,It's nice to meet you.
1082,3168736,3171673,"I see you're in possession
of a truly wonderful power."
1083,3172740,3176309,"And I believe, that such
great power ought to be used"
1084,3176443,3178478,to create great opportunities.
1085,3178613,3180848,"Have you ever questioned the
current state of the world"
1086,3180982,3183383,"where jujutsu
sorcerers act in secret"
1087,3183518,3185920,"to protect the order
of commonplace society."
1088,3186054,3187454,Hmm?
1089,3187588,3190124,"You see, my friend, there's
this established paradox"
1090,3190290,3193795,"that mistakenly says the strong
must accommodate the weak."
1091,3195228,3197799,It's so deplorable.
1092,3197932,3199232,Okay.
1093,3199366,3201334,"It's as if the apex of
all creation decided"
1094,3201468,3203370,"to halt its own
path of evolution."
1095,3203504,3204972,It's nonsense.
1096,3205106,3207374,"And it's time for mankind
to reconsider its strategy"
1097,3207508,3208943,for survival.
1098,3209077,3213447,"Which is exactly why we
would like you to help us."
1099,3213581,3214882,Help you with what?
1100,3215850,3217652,"We're going to kill
all non-sorcerers,"
1101,3217785,3220555,"and create a world
of jujutsu sorcerers."
1102,3221923,3222790,[Maki] What?
1103,3222924,3224759,[Panda] Is he serious?
1104,3224892,3226127,(Toge grunts)
1105,3226259,3227260,[Satoru] Do me a favor.
1106,3227394,3228830,Hmm?
1107,3228963,3230230,"Could you please stop
preaching your crazy beliefs"
1108,3230363,3231566,to my students?
1109,3234202,3236571,"Satoru, long time no see."
1110,3236704,3239941,"Step away from those
kids right now, Suguru."
1111,3242210,3245146,"I heard this new first-year
class is simply outstanding."
1112,3245278,3246379,Seems it's true.
1113,3246514,3248649,"You still have an
eye for talent."
1114,3248783,3252587,"A special-grade cursed human,
a cursed corpse mutation,"
1115,3252720,3254722,a cursed speech user.
1116,3254856,3258325,"And last, the Zen'in
clan's biggest failure."
1117,3258458,3259326,(Maki groans)
1118,3259459,3260595,You piece of shit.
1119,3260728,3262496,"You better watch
that mouth of yours."
1120,3262630,3265298,"Because I don't need any
monkeys like you in the world"
1121,3265432,3266834,that I'm creating.
1122,3270470,3271939,I'm sorry.
1123,3272073,3275643,"I don't really understand
anything you're talking about"
1124,3276778,3280915,"but I can't help anyone
who insults my friends."
1125,3281048,3282950,So count me out.
1126,3283084,3284252,(Suguru sighs)
1127,3284384,3285820,My apologies.
1128,3285953,3287955,"I didn't come here to
insult you, or your friends."
1129,3288089,3289322,That's good to know.
1130,3289456,3291526,"Then why exactly
did you come here?"
1131,3293060,3294996,I came to declare war.
1132,3296130,3298599,Everyone gathered here today.
1133,3298733,3302335,"I want you all to open your
ears and listen closely."
1134,3302469,3305673,"On December 24th,
when the sun sets,"
1135,3305807,3308976,"we shall begin the Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons."
1136,3309110,3310343,(Yaga grunts)
1137,3310477,3314715,"At the crucible of
curses, Shinjuku, Tokyo,"
1138,3315650,3318953,"as well as the holy
land of jujutsu, Kyoto."
1139,3319086,3322523,"A thousand curses will be
unleashed upon each place."
1140,3322657,3325092,All with the command massacre.
1141,3325226,3327795,"If you wish to avoid a
scene straight from hell,"
1142,3327929,3329831,come to your best to stop it.
1143,3331065,3335136,"Let us freely curse
each other to the death."
1144,3335269,3338471,(suspenseful music)
1145,3340608,3341843,(Nanako shouts)
1146,3341976,3342977,Mr. Geto.
1147,3343110,3345012,The cafe is gonna close.
1148,3345146,3346814,"Oh, is it that late already?"
1149,3346948,3348683,"You know how it is, don't you?"
1150,3348816,3351252,"These girls just have to
get their favorite crepes"
1151,3351384,3353054,from Takeshita Street.
1152,3353187,3354222,"Come on, hurry up."
1153,3354354,3355823,I'll be taking my leave now.
1154,3355957,3357992,"Nanago, I really don't
see what's so good"
1155,3358125,3360061,"about a place with
so many monkeys."
1156,3360194,3362763,"You didn't think we'd
just let you leave?"
1157,3364131,3365800,"Careful, Suturu."
1158,3365933,3368703,(monster grunts)
1159,3370638,3373574,(monster growls)
1160,3373708,3376244,"Your precious students
are well within my range."
1161,3376376,3378913,(monsters growling)
1162,3379046,3380014,Goodbye everybody.
1163,3380147,3381582,See you at the war.
1164,3383117,3385887,(wings whooshes)
1165,3395395,3397098,"[Suguru] Survival
of the weakest."
1166,3397231,3399867,"That's the proper form
society should take."
1167,3400001,3403137,"Help the weak, and
discourage the strong."
1168,3403271,3404705,"Listen, Satoru."
1169,3404839,3408475,"Sorcerers exist to
protect non-sorcerers."
1170,3408609,3410244,[Satoru] That's your argument?
1171,3410378,3412079,"God, I hate righteousness."
1172,3415883,3417652,"Do you think that
you're the strongest"
1173,3417785,3419887,because you're Satoru Gojo?
1174,3420021,3422890,"Or are you Satoru Gojo
because you're the strongest?"
1175,3423024,3424926,"What exactly are
you trying to say?"
1176,3425059,3427228,"If I could switch
places with you"
1177,3427361,3429130,then wouldn't my foolish ideals
1178,3429263,3431098,become reasonable possibilities?
1179,3434702,3436837,My path leads elsewhere.
1180,3436971,3440074,"And I plan on following it
to the best of my ability."
1181,3441575,3444578,(dramatic music)
1182,3479914,3482183,"Suguru Geto, a
special-grade curse user"
1183,3482316,3484785,"who uses cursed
spirit manipulation."
1184,3484919,3486454,Able to draw in and manipulate
1185,3486587,3488522,"naturally occurring
unbound curses."
1186,3488656,3489857,That's his skill.
1187,3491125,3492326,"It seems he's recently
established"
1188,3492460,3493928,a new religious group
1189,3494061,3496731,"so that curses can be
collected from its followers."
1190,3496864,3499433,"This explains the recent
decline in reported curses."
1191,3499567,3502703,"He already possessed a
significant number of curses,"
1192,3502837,3505239,"and it's for certain
he now has a lot more."
1193,3506140,3507942,"He claims to possess
2,000 of them"
1194,3508075,3509844,and that may not be a bluff.
1195,3509977,3511645,"But statistically,
most of them have got"
1196,3511779,3514181,"to be weaker grade-two
curses or below."
1197,3514315,3515850,"Also estimating generously,"
1198,3515983,3518185,"he can't have much more
than 50 curse users."
1199,3518319,3521355,"That's actually the part
that frightens me the most."
1200,3521489,3522823,I find it hard to believe
1201,3522957,3525493,"that he'd want to start a
war that he couldn't win."
1202,3525626,3527228,God damn.
1203,3527361,3528562,(Yaga grunts)
1204,3528696,3530297,"Put out a call for
aid to all alumni,"
1205,3530431,3534235,"alert the three major clans
and the Ainu Jujutsu Society."
1206,3534368,3535703,It's all-out war.
1207,3535836,3538105,"And it's not just the
curses we'll exorcize,"
1208,3538806,3539907,it's Geto.
1209,3540041,3541175,That muscle-brained principal
1210,3541308,3543778,"must be having a
fit right about now."
1211,3543911,3547114,(suspenseful music)
1212,3554121,3556690,"If we seriously tried
to kill each other,"
1213,3556824,3561295,"our chance of success
would be about 30%."
1214,3561429,3564533,(man grunts)
1215,3564665,3566100,(man grunts)
1216,3566233,3569870,"If the Jujutsu Society
joins, barely a 20% chance."
1217,3571172,3574275,"However, there is one move
that makes that slim chance"
1218,3574408,3576110,of victory jump way up.
1219,3577278,3579647,Straight up to 99%.
1220,3579780,3582049,"I kill Yuta Okkotsu,"
1221,3582183,3584553,"and obtain the special-grade
cursed apparition,"
1222,3584685,3586187,Rika Orimoto.
1223,3587154,3589023,"They completely bought
my bluff back there"
1224,3589156,3592660,"and now they're gonna give
me exactly what I want."
1225,3592793,3595296,"It doesn't matter if the
cursed spirit is bound."
1226,3595429,3597598,"So long as I kill its master,"
1227,3597731,3600267,I can absorb any curse I want.
1228,3601936,3603437,"The school likes
their odds of winning,"
1229,3603572,3606841,"so they won't play Yuta
Okkotsu as one of their cards."
1230,3606974,3608909,"After all, if he unleashes Rika,"
1231,3609043,3610811,she could wipe out both sides.
1232,3611178,3613914,"The aim of the Night Parade
of a Hundred Demons is"
1233,3614048,3616217,"to get Okkotsu alone
and unprotected."
1234,3618819,3623124,"Now, let's raise the
curtain on a new age."
1235,3625326,3627094,"Well, I guess,"
1236,3628996,3631499,something crazy is going down.
1237,3632133,3633535,"- (door slams)
- (Yuta groans)"
1238,3633667,3634835,"- Maki.
- Huh?"
1239,3634969,3636137,What are you doing here?
1240,3636270,3638072,"Classes are canceled
for the week."
1241,3638205,3641008,"Well, I was just
feeling kinda restless."
1242,3641142,3644111,"Doesn't seem like anyone's
around in the dorms either."
1243,3644245,3645646,"That's because the
second-year students"
1244,3645779,3647848,were all dispatched to Kyoto.
1245,3647982,3651118,"Toge's in Shinjuku with
some others as backup."
1246,3651252,3653654,"And since the Principal
likes Panda so much,"
1247,3653787,3655489,he's probably with Toge too.
1248,3655624,3656824,I see.
1249,3661795,3663464,"- Go ahead.
- Huh?"
1250,3663598,3664999,"I know you wanna ask,"
1251,3665132,3667636,"about why Geto said
I was a failure."
1252,3667768,3671705,"No, I, well, yeah."
1253,3673642,3675510,(Maki sighs)
1254,3675644,3677244,My family is the Zen'in clan.
1255,3677378,3681182,"One of the three major families
of elite jujutsu sorcerers."
1256,3681315,3683717,"Do you have any idea what
the minimum requirement is"
1257,3683851,3685386,to be a jujutsu sorcerer?
1258,3685520,3687321,"Huh, let me think."
1259,3690024,3691725,"[Maki] It's being
able to see curses."
1260,3691859,3693294,"Oh, yeah, right."
1261,3693427,3696665,"Ordinary people, even
they sometimes see curses,"
1262,3696797,3699066,"like when they're
at death's door."
1263,3699200,3701001,"But I can't see curses
without the help"
1264,3701135,3703070,of these lame glasses.
1265,3703204,3705507,"The cursed tools I use are
imbued with cursed energy"
1266,3705640,3706941,by someone else.
1267,3707074,3708342,It doesn't come from me.
1268,3710211,3713013,"At least this helped get
me out of that family."
1269,3713147,3715082,"The food was awful, the
rooms were minuscule,"
1270,3715216,3717686,"and it was crawling
with strange old men."
1271,3717818,3720054,"The whole experience
totally sucked."
1272,3722223,3723958,Don't use my last name.
1273,3724091,3725527,Not everyone's like you.
1274,3725660,3728329,"Most people don't have
resistance to curses."
1275,3728462,3730864,"Don't ask me about
cursed energy."
1276,3734569,3737805,"[Yuta] So then why are you
still a jujutsu sorcerer?"
1277,3737938,3740207,Because I happen to be spiteful.
1278,3741008,3743043,"I plan on returning
to my family one day"
1279,3743177,3745112,as a grade-one sorcerer.
1280,3745246,3748249,"And then I'll obliterate
the Zen'in clan from within."
1281,3748382,3750884,"I'll show them that you
don't need to see curses"
1282,3751018,3752486,to be a great sorcerer.
1283,3756390,3757458,What is it?
1284,3757592,3760361,"I was just thinking,
that's so like you."
1285,3761696,3762896,"I wish,"
1286,3764231,3766668,I wish I could be just like you.
1287,3766800,3769638,"You know, strong,
and determined."
1288,3769770,3772507,(gentle music)
1289,3776910,3778212,"Honestly, Maki."
1290,3778345,3780481,"You're the shame
of the Zen'in clan."
1291,3780615,3781949,I wish you were never born.
1292,3782082,3783450,"Everyone, look."
1293,3783585,3785152,Look at Maki.
1294,3786153,3788355,"You don't want to
turn out like her."
1295,3796864,3799634,"If there's ever anything I can
help you with, just ask me."
1296,3799768,3803370,"You know, like, obliterating
your clan or something."
1297,3803505,3806307,(Yuta giggles)
1298,3806907,3808242,You moron.
1299,3808375,3810512,"There's no point if I
don't do it by myself."
1300,3811646,3812813,I'm going back to my room.
1301,3812946,3814516,"[Yuta] Okay, later."
1302,3814649,3817519,(door whooshes)
1303,3819119,3821088,"Come on, Maki,
don't be an idiot."
1304,3822323,3824958,"Don't start believing that
you've really been accepted."
1305,3826327,3829496,"Emerge from darkness
blacker still."
1306,3829631,3832333,Purify that which is impure.
1307,3832466,3835503,(veil squelching)

1310,3837639,3839440,(suspenseful music)
1311,3839574,3842042,"A veil's being drawn
over the school?"
1312,3842176,3843444,But by who and why?
1313,3844646,3847448,(monsters grunting)
1314,3849651,3851352,"Try to keep the
destruction of buildings"
1315,3851485,3853320,"and the infrastructure
to a minimum."
1316,3853454,3856156,"There's a chance some civilians
still haven't evacuated."
1317,3856290,3858459,"If you find any, get
them out of here."
1318,3859059,3860562,"Are you listening to me, Gojo?"
1319,3861328,3864599,"There's one who may
cause us some trouble."
1320,3865999,3868536,"That bandaged guy,
I'll take him on."
1321,3869436,3870538,Sounds good.
1322,3870672,3872540,"We'll take on the other
jujutsu sorcerers."
1323,3872674,3873907,Just one last reminder.
1324,3874041,3875376,"Yeah, I know."
1325,3875510,3877311,"We're only supposed
to be stalling them."
1326,3877444,3880013,"Let's just take it
easy and have some fun"
1327,3880147,3882416,until Geto finishes his job.
1328,3882550,3884552,What are you doing here?
1329,3884686,3886120,Is it a problem that I am?
1330,3886253,3889390,"I think the real question
is, what are you doing here?"
1331,3890658,3892092,"Sorry about this,"
1332,3892226,3894562,"but I don't have time
to chat with monkeys."
1333,3895229,3897565,"[Ijichi] Gojo, I have a report."
1334,3899099,3900568,What's the matter?
1335,3900702,3901902,Oh.
1336,3902704,3904204,"That guy loves to show off,"
1337,3904338,3906574,"and yet he's not
on the front lines?"
1338,3906708,3908175,Is he in Kyoto?
1339,3908308,3911211,"We should have received
some kind of word if he was."
1340,3911345,3913515,"Just lost in thought, what's up?"
1341,3913648,3915949,"I know this isn't
really the best time,"
1342,3916083,3917451,but I thought you should know.
1343,3917585,3919286,"It's about the
investigation into Yuta"
1344,3919420,3921422,that you requested earlier.
1345,3924626,3925492,(Satoru gasps)
1346,3925627,3926493,"[Satoru] Panda, Toge."
1347,3926628,3927762,Hmm?
1348,3927896,3928962,What is it?
1349,3929096,3930532,"- (Panda groaning)
- No questions."
1350,3930665,3933635,"I'm sending both of you
to Jujutsu High right now."
1351,3933768,3935002,Huh?
1352,3935135,3936003,[Satoru] Geto is there.
1353,3936136,3937237,He has to be.
1354,3937371,3938840,I'm absolutely certain of it.
1355,3938972,3939841,Probably.
1356,3939973,3941141,"Well, which is it?"
1357,3941275,3942744,"[Satoru] If my
intuition is right,"
1358,3942877,3944978,Yuta and Maki might both die.
1359,3945112,3946648,(Panda gasps)
1360,3946781,3948982,"I'll join you after I take
care of that foreign sorcerer."
1361,3949116,3950384,Protect the two of them.
1362,3950518,3952587,Defend them with your lives.
1363,3954288,3956089,"- Right.

1366,3959627,3961128,"[Suda] No way, they
figured it out?"
1367,3961261,3962530,"[Miguel] This is why I said,"
1368,3962664,3965098,"you should at least
prepare a stand-in."
1369,3965232,3967100,"Geto didn't wanna
use a bad dummy."
1370,3967234,3969470,"He said it would
make things worse."
1371,3969604,3970605,"Mimiko, Nanako."
1372,3971438,3972306,What?
1373,3972574,3973875,"[Suda] We're
stepping up the plan."
1374,3974007,3975108,Engage.
1375,3975242,3976443,(Nanako giggles)
1376,3978546,3980548,I've been waiting for this.
1377,3980682,3982684,(suspenseful music)
1378,3982817,3984886,Let me introduce myself.
1379,3985018,3987789,"I'm Miguel, your opponent."
1380,3987922,3992627,"[Satoru] Sorry, Miguel but
I'm in a hurry right now."
1381,3996163,3997030,(wind whooshes)
1382,3997164,3998131,A veil's been drawn.
1383,3998265,4000033,Satoru's intuition was right.
1384,4000167,4001569,I'll break the veil.
1385,4001703,4003605,"Then we'll take the
shortest most direct route."
1386,4003738,4004639,Let's go.

1389,4007709,4008843,(Suguru giggles)
1390,4008977,4011546,"Looks like someone made
a hole in the veil."

1392,4013080,4016083,"It seems like these things
never go quite as planned."
1393,4016216,4018018,"It should take them
about five minutes"
1394,4018151,4020487,"from the point of
entry to get here."
1395,4020622,4023791,"Should I ignore them, or
should I take care of them?"
1396,4024993,4027494,It's just so hard to decide.
1397,4028696,4031733,(explosion booms)
1398,4032834,4034167,Did they break through the walls
1399,4034301,4036704,"to take the shortest
route to me?"
1400,4036838,4038472,Not bad.

1498,4320353,4321656,Healing with cursed energy
1499,4321789,4324892,"requires an advanced
reverse cursed technique."

and it's hard to focus at."

1570,4516317,4519653,"The way Mr. Geto puts
it, black is white,"
1571,4519787,4521989,"and white is black, too."
1572,4524992,4526727,"When Mr. Geto found us,"
1573,4526861,4530765,"he shared his vision for
a wonderful new world."

1578,4540274,4541375,What are you doing here?
1579,4541510,4543210,Take a look and figure it out.
1580,4543344,4545246,[Satoru] You're a tenacious one.
1581,4545913,4548783,(rope whooshes)
1582,4549917,4553687,"That rope, it has an
unusual curse woven into it."
1583,4553821,4555756,It's disrupting my techniques.
1584,4556757,4558993,"[Miguel] I barely have
half of my rope left."
1585,4559126,4561562,"How many decades do you
think it took the sorcerers"
1586,4561695,4566233,"in my country to weave this
rope imbued with cursed energy?"
1587,4566367,4567536,Like I care.

in about one second."

1596,4582416,4584585,"[Miguel] So, this is the
limitless jujutsu technique"
1597,4584718,4586020,that Geto mentioned.
1598,4586153,4588222,"It interferes on
an atomic level,"
1599,4588355,4589924,controlling space and time
1600,4590057,4593160,"with precise manipulation
of cursed energy."
1601,4593294,4596831,"And what makes it all possible
is the power of his eyes."

Look at this."
1629,4690625,4691825,What were you all doing?
1630,4691959,4693260,You're gonna be okay.

existence of higher beings"

awfully strange?"

those weak monkeys,"

can defeat the strong,"

like that too abruptly,"

you're right or wrong."

remain here with my friends"

okay that I'm still alive."
1702,4912012,4913981,I know what I have to do.

but to kill you."

important in life."

gathering curses."
1819,5316818,5321321,"Next time, I'll get my
hands on her for sure."
1820,5326661,5330631,"You're late again
as usual, Satoru."
1821,5331933,5334702,"To think you'd be the
one here at my end."
1822,5334836,5337104,"Are you going to make
sure my family is safe?"
1823,5337238,5340541,"Every last one of them
managed to escape to safety."
1824,5340675,5343476,"The ones in Kyoto, they
were under your command?"
1825,5344212,5345680,"Yes, they all were."
1826,5345813,5349183,"I'm a kind person
unlike you, Satoru."
1827,5350417,5353054,"You sent those two assuming
that I'd defeat them,"
1828,5353187,5354055,didn't you?
1829,5354188,5356257,To set Okkotsu off.
1830,5356389,5358491,I trusted you'd be yourself.
1831,5358626,5360728,"Trusted that a man
as principled as you"
1832,5360862,5364265,"wouldn't kill off young
sorcerers without a reason."
1833,5364397,5365333,(Geto chuckles)
1834,5365465,5367001,You wanna talk about trust?
1835,5370905,5373774,"I didn't think I had
any of that left in me,"
1836,5373908,5376010,"after everything
I've been through."
1837,5378813,5380615,"Return this for me, will you?"
1838,5382917,5386120,"[Satoru] Was the elementary
school your doing, too?"
1839,5386254,5387521,It was.
1840,5387655,5389123,I can't believe you.
1841,5391025,5393961,"Tell me, do you
have any last words?"
1842,5395029,5399867,"No matter what anyone tells
you, I hate those monkeys."
1843,5401335,5403738,But I never held any hatred
1844,5403871,5406073,"for those in
Jujutsu High School."
1845,5407041,5409844,"I just couldn't wear
a heartfelt smile"
1846,5409977,5411712,while living in this world.
1847,5414515,5416017,Suguru.
1848,5416150,5418920,(dramatic music)
1849,5434434,5435736,(Geto chuckles)
1850,5435870,5438906,"The least you could do is
hit me with some curses."
1851,5453254,5454454,(slicing)
1852,5456791,5459760,"- [Maki] Hey, wake up.
- [Panda] Yuta, Yuta."
1853,5461329,5463331,"Hey, Yuta, are you okay?"
1854,5463463,5464365,[Toge] Mustard leaf.
1855,5464497,5467034,"Come on and wake up, Yuta."
1856,5467668,5468970,(Yuta groans)
1857,5469103,5470237,"Good, he's awake."
1858,5471238,5473140,(Yuta groans)
1859,5473274,5474041,You're all here.
1860,5474175,5476043,"Maki, your okay?"
1861,5476177,5477178,Inumaki.
1862,5477311,5479981,"Whoa, Panda, your
arm hasn't healed."
1863,5480114,5481349,"Chill out, dude."
1864,5481481,5483818,"We're all doing way better
than you are right now."
1865,5483951,5486153,"Unlike these other two losers,"
1866,5486287,5487955,my arm can be fixed later.
1867,5488089,5490558,"By the way, thanks
for saving us, Yuta."
1868,5490691,5491859,[Toge] Salmon.
1869,5492360,5493928,(Yuta groans)
1870,5494061,5495062,[Rika] Yuta.
1871,5501535,5502636,[Panda] Hmm?
1872,5502770,5504739,"Sorry about that, Rika."
1873,5504872,5506474,"I didn't mean to
keep you waiting."
1874,5506607,5508009,[Panda] What's the matter?
1875,5508142,5509143,Yuta?
1876,5509977,5514215,"Well, you see, in exchange
for borrowing her power,"
1877,5514348,5517551,"I kind of promised to go and
live with Rika from now on."
1878,5517685,5518853,"[Maki] What?
Are you crazy?"
1879,5518986,5520588,Don't you know that means dying?
1880,5520721,5522089,"What were you
thinking, you idiot?"
1881,5522223,5525026,"Well, I was caught off
in the moment, I guess."
1882,5525159,5526093,I don't know.
1883,5526227,5527328,Huh?
1884,5527461,5528662,Huh?
1885,5529463,5530564,[Yuta] Rika?
1886,5530698,5532199,(Satoru claps)
1887,5532333,5533601,Congratulations.
1888,5533734,5535669,You managed to break the curse.
1889,5535803,5537138,[All] Who're you?
1890,5537271,5539940,"I'm your good-looking
teacher, Satoru Gojo."
1891,5540741,5542343,"I thought the
theory Yuta came up"
1892,5542476,5543878,with sounded interesting.
1893,5544011,5547148,"So, I requested an investigation
into their families."
1894,5547281,5548883,"The investigation
about Rika's family"
1895,5549016,5550918,"came to me long time ago,"
1896,5551052,5554523,"but Yuta's history was
full of holes at best."
1897,5554655,5557058,"That's when it
finally came to light."
1898,5558025,5560761,"You're the descendant
of Sugawara Michizane,"
1899,5560895,5563197,"which makes us super
distant relatives."
1900,5563330,5564198,[Panda And Maki] Suga?
1901,5564331,5565566,Who's Suga?
1902,5565699,5567468,"One of Japan's three
great apparitions."
1903,5567601,5569370,He was a super bigshot sorcerer.
1904,5569504,5570704,[Toge] Tuna.
1905,5570838,5572573,"You were right the
whole time, Yuta."
1906,5572706,5574909,"Rika didn't place
a curse on you."
1907,5575042,5577812,You placed a curse on Rika.
1908,5582517,5584151,"[Yuta] Rika, what do I do?"
1909,5584285,5585419,Is she going to die?
1910,5585554,5586887,I have to save her.
1911,5587021,5590791,"Don't die, don't die,
don't die, don't die."
1912,5592626,5594028,That's right.
1913,5594161,5598567,"At the time, I refused
to accept Rika's death."
1914,5598699,5602236,"Now the one who placed the
curse has canceled the bond."
1915,5603370,5604772,As long as the person
1916,5604905,5607308,"who was cursed doesn't seek
retribution against you,"
1917,5607441,5609310,the curse is fully broken.
1918,5609443,5610811,"Of course, that much was obvious"
1919,5610945,5613047,after seeing her in that form.
1920,5613180,5615382,(Yuta cries)
1921,5616183,5618219,"It was all my fault, wasn't it?"
1922,5619086,5620955,I turned you into that form.
1923,5622223,5626227,"I hurt all those people and I
nearly caused everyone to die"
1924,5626360,5628863,when Geto came after me.
1925,5628996,5631765,"It's all, it's all my fault."
1926,5632567,5635302,(Yuta cries)
1927,5635436,5640174,"Yuta, thank you for
giving me more time,"
1928,5640307,5643010,"and letting me
stay by your side."
1929,5643144,5645246,"During the six
years I was cursed,"
1930,5645379,5648115,"I've been happier than
I ever was before."
1931,5649917,5652319,(Yuta cries)
1932,5661962,5663898,"Bye, Yuta, take care."
1933,5667101,5671138,"And don't cross to my
side anytime soon, okay?"
1934,5671939,5673340,See you later.
1935,5673474,5676076,(gentle music)
1936,5709210,5711011,"It's a bit late to tell you,"
1937,5711145,5713948,"but you weren't at fault
for the incident with Geto."
1938,5714081,5715684,"He would've attacked
to Jujutsu High School"
1939,5715816,5717284,whether you were here or not.
1940,5717418,5718553,You think so?
1941,5718687,5720454,I believe this is yours.
1942,5720589,5722022,"Oh, my student ID."
1943,5722156,5724091,"Thanks for finding
it for me, Gojo."
1944,5725492,5728762,"No, it wasn't me."
1945,5728896,5730364,My best friend found it.
1946,5731465,5733200,My only friend really.
1947,5735302,5736270,"Come on, Yuta."
1948,5736403,5738405,"How long are you
gonna keep us waiting?"
1949,5739273,5740274,Ready to go?
1950,5741742,5744579,(Yuta chuckles)
1951,5744713,5747414,(gentle music)
1952,5747549,5748749,[Yuta] Yeah.
1953,5759728,5764932,(singing in Japanese)
1954,6043978,6049182,(upbeat music)
1955,6068168,6073373,(singing in Japanese)
1956,6228996,6231933,(birds chirping)
1957,6238338,6240942,(horn honking)
1958,6242043,6244712,(car whooshing)
1959,6245546,6248716,(crowd chattering)
1960,6251586,6254387,(Yuta giggles)
1961,6256356,6257390,This is good.
1962,6257525,6259326,Didn't I tell you so?
1963,6259459,6261696,"I used this great
spice called Royco."
1964,6261829,6264431,"That's what gives it
that amazing flavor."
1965,6265900,6267168,Huh?
1966,6267300,6269070,"Royco is a magic powder
that makes every dish taste"
1967,6269203,6271973,"like it was made in
Kenya when you add it in."
1968,6272106,6275610,"More importantly, they really
went home, didn't they?"
1969,6276577,6277879,(Yuta groans)
1970,6278012,6278913,For that I'm happy.
1971,6279781,6281182,[Yuta] This really is good.
1972,6281314,6283084,Reminds me of nikujaga.
1973,6283217,6284252,Nikujaga?
1974,6284384,6285520,"That's too hard to pronounce,"
1975,6285653,6287688,"so let's just call
it, beef stew."
1976,6287822,6289724,(Miguel giggles)
1977,6289857,6290525,Hmm?
1978,6290658,6291926,What's the matter?
1979,6292059,6295462,"[Miguel] Well, well,
what are you doing here?"
1980,6296764,6297765,What the?
1981,6298933,6299600,Gojo?
1982,6299734,6301836,"Hey, long time no see."
