1,173758,175509,"- Yeah, sure.
- Then what?"
2,175593,177386,"We can get tickets
for something to see?"
3,178512,180806,"- We can see the symphony.
- Huh?"
4,180890,182683,It'll finish really late.
5,182767,184101,We can catch the last train out.
6,252128,254255,"Excuse me.
Could you give me a light?"
7,254338,256549,"Yeah, sure."
8,256632,258175,"You're Americans, yes?"
9,258259,259927,"Yes, sir. We're on a summer trip."
10,262596,266392,"Please, take this to your embassy."
11,266475,268853,It is vital. I have no other way.
12,268936,270104,Come on. Let's get out of here.
13,270187,272940,"Do not go back to your hotel,
straight to the embassy."
14,273023,276485,"Give this only to Deputy Chief of Mission.
Understand?"
15,328162,330206,"- Thank you.
- Mm."
16,330289,332750,"- Emily. Lovely as ever.
- Ah!"
17,332833,335544,"- You do brighten up the old place.
- Oh, thank you."
18,335628,336670,"- Emily?
- Sir."
19,336754,338005,"- Please sit down.
- Ah."
20,339465,341759,I've brought you boys a present.
21,351227,352853,"Ah, thank you."
22,354730,355731,"Rachel, step out."
23,361904,365032,"- ""I fear a nuclear war is coming"
24,365115,367910,"and I want to help you prevent it."""
25,367993,369078,It's got my attention.
26,370538,371872,He's smart.
27,371956,374291,Gave us a photo only we'd have copies of
28,374375,377253,"from a few years ago
at our embassy in Turkey."
29,377336,382841,"Say hello
to Colonel Oleg Vladimirovich Penkovsky."
30,382925,384593,"Code name ""Ironbark."""
31,384677,388639,"Artillery officer during the war,
decorated 13 times."
32,388722,392059,"Now, he's back in Moscow running the State
Committee for Scientific Research."
33,392142,393727,But that's just a cover.
34,395145,396564,He's GRU.
35,401819,403862,Why the dossier?
36,403946,405781,"Hand like this, I keep close to my chest."
37,405864,407950,"Because they have no way
to make contact."
38,408033,413080,"The CIA is weak in Moscow
after that... disaster with Popov."
39,413163,415082,Am I right?
40,415165,418294,"We're thin on the ground.
We need your help."
41,420379,421380,Let's hear him out.
42,421463,423716,"We've got a number
of good officers in our embassy."
43,423799,426969,"I'll have one make contact with Penkovsky,
get this sorted out."
44,427052,428345,I did have a thought.
45,429346,432600,This is a GRU Colonel. He's so visible.
46,432683,435853,"I'm worried we could blow Penkovsky
just by making an approach."
47,435936,439231,"That's always a risk.
What would the CIA have us do instead?"
48,440232,441483,I don't know.
49,441567,448282,"Maybe use someone outside the embassy
who the KGB won't suspect?"
50,448365,451952,"Say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world."
51,452036,456206,"Do we know of someone
who could fit the bill?"
52,456290,460544,"I have to warn you,
I have a pretty good feeling about this."
53,463130,464131,"Oh, hell."
54,466258,469511,"And Greville,
that is the saddest thing I've ever seen."
55,469595,471722,"Well, serves me right,"
56,471805,474558,- I should keep my mouth shut.
57,474642,477519,Now we have to make it up.
58,477603,480773,"- We probably have some brochures.
- Of what?"
59,480856,482566,"A drink first, I think."
60,485736,487488,You know my reputation.
61,487571,489865,- Parts I want you to know anyway.
62,489948,493869,"I represent the top manufacturers
who sell the best products on the market."
63,493952,497498,"So, in combination with you gentlemen
knowing your business,"
64,497581,500584,"I think it'd be much better
if instead of my usual song and dance,"
65,500668,503504,"I just listen.
You tell me what your problems are,"
66,503587,506840,"and if I think I have a client
that may have a solution,"
67,506924,510969,"let's talk it through.
If not, let's keep drinking."
68,511053,514056,"So, tell me, what do you need?"
69,514139,515683,"- Thanks, Greville.
- Bye."
70,546672,548799,It still doesn't add up.
71,548882,551176,"Well, did you miss something maybe?"
72,552761,554847,"- Like carrying the four?
- Oh, yes."
73,554930,556849,"- Oh, yes.
- How are you?"
74,556932,559518,"Oh, very well.
Except our son keeps confusing"
75,559601,561979,"me helping with his homework
with me doing it for him."
76,562062,563689,"- Oh.
- How was your day?"
77,563772,567693,"Oh, the usual. Some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up."
78,567776,570404,"No, really, you should have seen me.
I sold a dozen lace"
79,570487,573490,"by throwing the easiest putt
in the history of putting."
80,573574,577119,"- I feel filthy.
- No, no. You have to play golf badly."
81,577202,579413,"- But aren't you used to that?
- Ha-ha."
82,579496,583417,"Well, just think another 23 years of this
and then we're off to the good life."
83,583500,585461,Or I could retire early.
84,585544,587713,"Andrew, you don't want
to go to university, do you?"
85,587796,589256,- Not really.
86,589339,592509,"- Perfect.
- Well, I'm not feeding either of you."
87,592593,593802,"Don't know what you're smiling at,"
88,593886,595429,"it'll be at least 50 years
until you can retire."
89,595512,598724,"- Greville Wynne, please?
- Yeah. Let me see if he's home."
90,598807,602853,"- Sounds like work.
- No. Tell them I'm in my chair."
91,602936,604688,Yes. He's just walked in.
92,611028,612237,Greville Wynne.
93,612321,615365,"Greville, this is James Dobbing
from the Board of Trade."
94,615449,616617,We met last year.
95,616700,618577,"Yes, yes. At the reception of Whitehall."
96,618660,620746,James! How good to hear from you.
97,620829,623957,"- James, hello.
- Greville."
98,624041,625042,I hope you don't mind.
99,625125,627711,"My friend Helen is a consultant
in from the States."
100,627795,629046,"I thought, ""Why not?"""
101,629129,631423,Greville Wynne. A real pleasure.
102,631507,633133,"Helen Talbot, likewise."
103,635677,637888,"James tells me you've been
working in Eastern Europe."
104,637971,641016,"Hmm. More and more.
Tremendous opportunities."
105,641099,642809,"Plenty of demand, no local supply."
106,643810,646772,"Czechoslovakia, Hungary."
107,646855,649650,- Ghastly food.
108,649733,653028,"- What about the Soviet Union?
- Well, not just yet. Someday."
109,653111,655197,"I'd like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first."
110,655280,657115,"Actually, now might be the perfect time."
111,657199,659284,"Oh, really? Why?
What did you hear?"
112,659368,660827,"Well, Helen and I have associates"
113,660911,663163,"who would be interested
to see what might come of it."
114,665541,668460,"It would be a real service
to Great Britain."
115,668544,669711,And the world.
116,686520,688438,Forgive me. I'm just a bit--
117,691066,694528,"Sorry. James, I know you said you had
an office in Board of Trade."
118,695988,696822,But...
119,698156,700534,"Is it possible
that you actually work..."
120,700617,703120,"at a different branch
of Her Majesty's government?"
121,707457,708458,"Oh, my."
122,711378,712921,This is unexpected.
123,714131,716800,"Sorry, I-- I don't understand."
124,716883,719720,"Why, I'm-I'm-- I'm just a salesman."
125,719803,724391,"Exactly. An ordinary salesman
with no connection to the government."
126,724474,725601,"Look, this is all fascinating,"
127,725684,729813,"and I-I really can't believe I'm actually
having lunch with spies."
128,731064,732065,But...
129,734067,736278,I couldn't possibly...
130,740324,744244,"- What would you want me to do?
- Nothing dodgy, nothing illegal,"
131,744328,747831,"- just what you would naturally do.
- I'm sorry. I don't follow."
132,747914,752127,"Someone in your field
hoping to do business in the Soviet Union,"
133,752210,754921,how would you get started?
134,755005,756465,"Well, I suppose I'd set up a meeting"
135,756548,759760,"with the State Committee
for Scientific Research in Moscow."
136,760761,762429,That sounds fine.
137,762512,765891,"So, you want me
to go to Moscow and then..."
138,768185,769436,Do business.
139,772981,776443,"All this secrecy must seem absurd,
but I promise, it's to help you."
140,776526,779237,"We want you to act exactly like
the ordinary businessman you are."
141,779321,781448,"That'll be much easier
if you don't know any details."
142,781531,783283,"Right. But would I be
putting myself in danger?"
143,783367,784951,"That detail, I-- I'd have to know."
144,785035,787037,"Greville, let me put this delicately."
145,787120,788455,You're a middle-aged businessman
146,788538,791375,"who drinks a bit too much
and isn't exactly in top shape."
147,791458,795087,"During the war, you were a private,
never even saw combat."
148,795170,798715,"My point is, if this mission
was the least bit dangerous,"
149,798799,801676,you really are the last man we'd send.
150,801760,804388,"Well, thank you
for putting it so delicately."
151,809393,812521,"Make sure you wear it
while you're in Moscow."
152,812604,814731,What does this do? Shoot poison darts?
153,814815,817067,"Thank you so much, Greville.
You're a good man."
154,817150,819319,"And I know we can count on you
to be discreet."
155,825075,827160,How was your day?
156,827244,830038,"Oh, it was fine."
157,832582,834960,"Mine was wonderful.
Thank you so much for asking."
158,835043,839089,"So sorry, I've got a head
full of contracts."
159,839172,841800,"Uh, you out with, uh, Tamara, weren't you?"
160,841883,844928,"Yes, we were at the club,
planning the charity dinner."
161,845011,846972,"- That was amusing.
- Huh!"
162,847055,850058,"Before you ask if you have to come,
yes, you have to come."
163,852436,855272,"- I've had an interesting lead.
- Really?"
164,855355,857774,"Might look at doing a little bit
of work in the Soviet Union."
165,857858,860902,"Hmm. Do stay out of The Gulag, darling."
166,932933,933934,Passport.
167,1007632,1009593,"How do you do?
Greville Wynne, pleasure."
168,1009676,1011011,"How do you do? Greville Wynne, pleasure."
169,1011094,1013346,How do you do? How do you do?
170,1013430,1016433,"And this is the head of our committee,
Oleg Penkovsky."
171,1016516,1018143,"Ah, pleasure to meet you."
172,1018226,1019853,Thank you for coming.
173,1019936,1025317,"I'm not here to tell you
what is best for Soviet industry."
174,1029404,1032198,"You gentlemen know that
far better than I ever will."
175,1034826,1038455,I'm here simply to open a door...
176,1042000,1045587,to the top manufacturers in the West.
177,1058308,1061019,Your proposal is interesting.
178,1062687,1065190,"- Would you like to have lunch?
- Of course."
179,1066274,1067525,After you.
180,1069486,1072113,"It is good you have dealt
with other communist governments,"
181,1072197,1074115,but so far from home.
182,1074199,1075950,Do you not prefer to work in England?
183,1076034,1078411,"I do what I can
to keep things interesting."
184,1080205,1083833,"But then, there's the political situation."
185,1085043,1087629,This is not a good time for East and West.
186,1087712,1091257,"Well, what I like to say is,
no matter what the politicians are doing,"
187,1091341,1096805,"factories still need machines,
machines still need parts."
188,1096888,1099599,"I'm a businessman, so I stick to business."
189,1105897,1106731,Hmm!
190,1111069,1115198,"- Do you have a family?
- I do, a boy, he's ten."
191,1115281,1116783,I wanted a boy very much.
192,1116866,1119869,"Then we had a girl.
Now she's my world."
193,1119953,1122664,"Mm. Likely not destroying your home
like our son."
194,1129337,1132048,Now... most important question.
195,1133633,1136720,"If you want to do business in Moscow,
I need to know."
196,1137721,1142016,"- Yes?
- Can you hold your alcohol?"
197,1145895,1148106,- It's my one true gift.
198,1162537,1164956,I want to show you another side of Russia.
199,1165039,1167083,"- Are you free this evening?
- Certainly."
200,1167167,1168668,Where are we off to?
201,1187312,1189189,Do you know Cinderella?
202,1191775,1195236,"Embarrassed to say,
I've never been to the ballet."
203,1195320,1198531,Then your trip is already worth it.
204,1199699,1201201,"If you will, mister."
205,1280864,1284325,"Your tie clip, I like it.
Where did you get it?"
206,1288246,1290498,It was a gift from a friend.
207,1290582,1294294,"- Is your friend American?
- Yes."
208,1297922,1301301,We can talk here. It is safe.
209,1303386,1305930,"I sent word to your friend. You're, um..."
210,1306014,1309934,"- I think the word is ""amateur.""
- Yes, exactly. Amateur."
211,1312270,1316190,"I've dreamt of this moment
for a very long time. Thank you."
212,1316274,1318109,"I wish I could tell you
how much this means."
213,1318192,1320737,"I think I'd rather
that you didn't tell me."
214,1322614,1324908,What happens now?
215,1324991,1327952,"- I don't need to do anything, do I?
- No, you go home."
216,1328036,1331205,"Then you invite me to visit London
with a trade delegation"
217,1331289,1332957,to meet your clients.
218,1333041,1336753,"- Your government would allow you?
- They would be thrilled."
219,1336836,1340340,"Part of my job
is to steal technology from the West."
220,1340423,1342467,Your friend is clever.
221,1344010,1346846,"Well, Oleg. May I call you Oleg?"
222,1346930,1350433,"In English, my name doesn't sound good.
Call me Alex."
223,1351768,1352852,Alex.
224,1358650,1360401,You're a good amateur.
225,1378836,1380213,"Since you took me to the Bolshoi,"
226,1380296,1383925,"I suppose I should take all of you
to the West End."
227,1384008,1385885,Some of the finest theater in the world.
228,1385969,1387512,That would be good.
229,1416624,1418584,"And this is my wife, Sheila."
230,1418668,1419752,"- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you."
231,1419836,1422380,"- Nostrovia!
- Nostrovia!"
232,1423506,1425091,Cheers!
233,1425174,1427010,"Up yours, as well.
That's another one."
234,1427093,1428511,"- Up yours!
- Up yours!"
235,1428594,1429929,"- Up yours!
- Up yours!"
236,1468760,1471095,"- Off you go.
- Hello."
237,1471179,1472555,"Hello, goodbye."
238,1564021,1565398,We know you're a patriot.
239,1565481,1568234,We know how hard this must be for you.
240,1570444,1572405,"Colonel, whatever brought you here..."
241,1573698,1577326,"it must frighten you
more than the danger of being here."
242,1583207,1584208,Khrushchev.
243,1585877,1588671,Khrushchev frightens me.
244,1588754,1591465,"He is impulsive, chaotic,"
245,1591549,1594218,"a man like him should have
no clear command."
246,1595928,1597972,The West has fallen for his lie.
247,1598055,1601642,"The lie that Soviet regime
is growing soft, it is not."
248,1601726,1605229,"Khrushchev wants confrontation
with America."
249,1605313,1608065,He's looking for one.
250,1608149,1611277,"Do you have anything you could share
with us? Documents, perhaps?"
251,1612737,1615406,"Would you like to read the new edition
of Military Thought?"
252,1620953,1622872,I need assurances from you.
253,1625875,1628169,If it becomes necessary...
254,1628252,1630463,I must be able to defect with my family.
255,1630546,1632798,Absolutely. Whenever you want.
256,1634759,1636594,I will remain in place
257,1636677,1639889,"and keep you updated
on the Kremlin's thinking."
258,1639972,1642016,But tell your government...
259,1643684,1646604,they must use my information wisely.
260,1646687,1648105,Not as a weapon...
261,1649398,1651651,but as a tool to bring peace.
262,1669835,1672588,"Despite what Khrushchev claims,"
263,1672672,1677260,"America's nuclear arsenal
is still far superior to ours."
264,1678261,1681222,We do not yet have first strike capacity.
265,1681305,1685059,"You can annihilate us,
but we cannot annihilate you."
266,1685142,1687645,But that won't worry the Politburo.
267,1687728,1691399,"Do you think in the end that'll keep
Khrushchev from going too far?"
268,1694443,1696112,You have to be up in a few hours.
269,1696195,1698656,"- I'm fine.
- No, he's right."
270,1698739,1700366,We can finish this up tomorrow night.
271,1702535,1704203,And one last thing.
272,1705288,1707415,We need to talk about Greville.
273,1707498,1710084,"Don't worry. You won't have
to deal with him anymore."
274,1714380,1717133,"- No.
- It was Penkovsky's idea."
275,1717216,1719969,"You're perfect, you're a civilian,
so the KGB won't be watching you."
276,1720052,1723306,"You'll be in and out of Moscow anyway
to setup contracts."
277,1723389,1725975,"You still won't know any specifics,
you'll just be a courier."
278,1726058,1727893,Just a courier for Russian se--
279,1731147,1733733,"My God, I can't believe
you're bloody serious."
280,1733816,1735276,We've gone over it with Penkovsky.
281,1735359,1738821,"We believe the risk to you is minimal.
And we'll pay you."
282,1738904,1741449,"I make my own money,
thank you very much."
283,1741532,1744327,I have a wife and a child.
284,1744410,1746203,Either of you have a family?
285,1747747,1749332,"Oh, no."
286,1749415,1750916,"Don't suppose
you could tell me about that."
287,1751000,1754045,"Not a lot you can tell me about,
is there? Helen, James."
288,1754128,1757506,"I can tell you we'd both put ourselves
in harm's way when necessary,"
289,1757590,1760051,"and this is terribly necessary, Greville."
290,1760134,1763971,"Then might I suggest you find someone
who's suited for it."
291,1764055,1766182,"Sorry. I really have done
all I can for you."
292,1766265,1767850,"Greville, listen."
293,1767933,1771020,"The four-minute warning,
it won't do you any good."
294,1771103,1773022,"- What?
- The four-minute warning"
295,1773105,1775524,"before a Soviet nuclear missile
hits the UK."
296,1775608,1778027,"No, I know what that--
What are you talking about?"
297,1778110,1781947,"That-that's what this has all been about?
Nuclear war? Come on."
298,1786035,1788829,"See, here's the problem for you."
299,1788913,1791248,"Your house is a 12-minute drive
from your office,"
300,1791332,1793626,"ten minutes if you really push, right?"
301,1793709,1795336,"And you're usually
out on a sales call anyway,"
302,1795419,1798255,"so you're not getting back
to Sheila in time."
303,1798339,1801717,"And Andrew's school, that's nine minutes
from your house, 15 from your office,"
304,1801801,1804720,"and no one's getting to him either.
He'll get herded into the school basement."
305,1805930,1808140,I looked up the building plans.
306,1808224,1810684,"That's a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter."
307,1810768,1812561,"Same with your basement, actually."
308,1812645,1815189,Only the government has decent shelters.
309,1818275,1819568,What do you do?
310,1821445,1822822,Hmm?
311,1822905,1825825,"You can spend those four minutes
trying to get Sheila on the phone,"
312,1825908,1828285,but you won't be able to get through.
313,1830037,1833833,"Or you can think about how you might have
helped stop this from happening..."
314,1835167,1836544,but you didn't.
315,1839755,1841549,And then that's it.
316,1844593,1846178,How dare you.
317,1859442,1862611,"Truly, we'll be better off
if he doesn't do it."
318,1862695,1863821,He'll do it.
319,1866740,1867867,"No, I got it."
320,1868951,1870077,All right.
321,1872663,1874540,"- Hello.
- Welcome. Do come in."
322,1874623,1876500,"- Oh! Hello.
- Hello."
323,1876584,1878836,"Oh, vodka, lovely."
324,1878919,1882465,"I was just saying to Greville
we didn't drink nearly enough last night."
325,1882548,1885676,"- Thank you. Uh, do come in.
- Thank you."
326,1887011,1888512,This is for Andrew.
327,1890055,1892892,"Very kind, thank you. This way."
328,1909158,1911327,Dad told me about Moscow.
329,1911410,1913329,What's it like in the rest of Russia?
330,1914497,1918000,"It is very beautiful.
Especially where I come from."
331,1918083,1921670,"A lot of trees, a lot of sky."
332,1922713,1923923,You feel...
333,1925382,1927885,very alone but in a good way.
334,1927968,1930137,I'd like to see that.
335,1930221,1931472,But then of course your government
336,1931555,1934975,"isn't all that keen on foreigners
just wandering around."
337,1937520,1940189,Do the Russians really hate us that much?
338,1940272,1943442,"I think they'd like our children
to be a little more polite, Andrew."
339,1944693,1946987,Our politicians hate your politicians.
340,1947071,1950324,"And yours hate ours, do not forget that."
341,1950407,1954411,"But the people,
your father and I, we do business."
342,1954495,1957831,"We spend time together,
I meet his family."
343,1959667,1962336,Maybe we're only two people...
344,1962419,1964088,but this is how things change.
345,1966340,1967174,Hmm.
346,1970928,1973305,"- What if I get caught?
- You won't."
347,1973389,1974932,You don't know that.
348,1976600,1978185,"They'd execute me, correct?"
349,1978269,1980312,"Not if they thought you're just a courier,"
350,1980396,1982731,"that you took packages
but didn't know what was in them."
351,1982815,1984733,"They would hold you to trade
for one of theirs."
352,1984817,1986360,For how long?
353,1986443,1988237,"- A couple of years.
- Oh, just a couple of years"
354,1988320,1990281,rotting in some Russian Gulag.
355,1990364,1994702,"They will not catch us.
The KGB will have no idea."
356,1994785,1997454,"Listen, I'm better at this than they are."
357,1997538,2002042,"- Fine. But I'm not.
- Look, your work..."
358,2003043,2007172,"It is only deception.
Controlling your emotion."
359,2007256,2009675,"I watched you do it in Moscow,
you did it tonight."
360,2009758,2011719,It's really not the same thing.
361,2011802,2014096,"If we're caught,
they would definitely execute me."
362,2014179,2015764,"Well, I'm very sorry,
but that's your choice."
363,2015848,2018684,"That is how sure I am
that you can do this."
364,2018767,2020561,I'm betting my life on it.
365,2023981,2025649,How can I explain this to Sheila?
366,2025733,2029778,"She cannot know the truth.
For her own safety, for yours."
367,2029862,2032489,"- I can't tell her any of it?
- No."
368,2032573,2034450,"Well, what have you told your wife?"
369,2036827,2039455,"Because you know what she'd say.
""Don't do it."""
370,2039538,2041915,"I'm right, aren't I?"
371,2041999,2045502,"Sheila's no fool. And in the past, I've..."
372,2045586,2047713,"given her reason not to trust me, dully."
373,2051008,2052509,Then you have to lie better.
374,2054219,2056096,There are good lies.
375,2056180,2058515,Sometimes a lie is a gift...
376,2059516,2061935,an act of love.
377,2062019,2063854,I'm sorry it has to be you.
378,2066315,2067524,"But, Greville..."
379,2068859,2070361,it has to be you.
380,2075574,2079828,"In Moscow, you must at all times
follow the rules of the art."
381,2079912,2081789,"In English, there's a word."
382,2081872,2083791,"- Tradecraft.
- Yes."
383,2083874,2085292,You must follow tradecraft.
384,2086293,2088545,"Everyone you meet,
assume they are KGB--"
385,2088629,2092174,"Waiters, hotel staff, my driver, everyone."
386,2092257,2097054,"Even if they are not actual KGB officers,
they still make reports to KGB."
387,2097137,2098263,Whoo!
388,2098347,2101141,Every Russian is an eye of the state.
389,2101225,2103936,"Every room you're in, assume it is bugged."
390,2104019,2105479,Even inside our embassy.
391,2105562,2108482,Especially inside your embassy.
392,2108565,2110818,"Still, our embassy
will be a good fail-safe"
393,2110901,2113862,in the event of any... complication.
394,2115197,2119576,"The KGB also uses lip readers.
You won't be able to tell who they are."
395,2119660,2120786,- So never discuss...
396,2120869,2123205,...anything sensitive unless I do first.
397,2123288,2124498,How's your family?
398,2124581,2127793,"Very well, thank you. How's yours?"
399,2128794,2131296,We will be seeing each other often.
400,2132297,2136510,"To throw off suspicion, I will tell
my colleagues I recruited you as a source."
401,2138262,2139596,You'll keep Colonel Penkovsky
402,2139680,2142099,"supplied with material on steel
manufacturing,"
403,2142182,2143725,industrial production and so on.
404,2144726,2147521,"Unclassified, but hard to come by."
405,2147604,2149481,They'll believe I would do that?
406,2150482,2152234,Of course.
407,2152317,2154528,You are a greedy capitalist.
408,2154611,2157489,You want to keep the contracts coming.
409,2157573,2160868,"And from now on,
every moment you're in Moscow,"
410,2160951,2162786,you will be selling one thing--
411,2164079,2167374,"The idea that you are
an ordinary businessman"
412,2167458,2170002,"and nothing more
than an ordinary businessman."
413,2170085,2172629,"Well, gentlemen, I hope
this is the first of many."
414,2172713,2175007,"Thank you all very, very much."
415,2175090,2177050,To good health and for business.
416,2178469,2180888,"- I should get you to the airport.
- Yes, yes, please."
417,2180971,2182222,Do you have any questions?
418,2182306,2184224,"Gentlemen, 'till next time. Thank you."
419,2185225,2187269,"I want to be certain
of one thing."
420,2188270,2190981,"I need to know
that if anything happens to me,"
421,2191064,2194401,my wife and son will be provided for.
422,2194485,2195944,You have my word.
423,2197154,2199072,And I speak for the Crown.
424,2225474,2227726,"- Thank you, Alex.
- Bye."
425,2234024,2235275,Thank you.
426,2293417,2297713,"- My, where did that come from?
- I missed you."
427,2297796,2301300,"- Well, just this one time.
- Oh, every time, darling."
428,2314229,2316440,They're really gearing up for war.
429,2316523,2320319,"This is phenomenal.
Ironbark's the real thing."
430,2321778,2325574,"Well, this just became the biggest thing
going in the whole Soviet Section."
431,2325657,2329411,"Now, if I keep you on this..."
432,2329494,2331622,am I gonna regret it?
433,2331705,2333415,"No, sir."
434,2335250,2341048,"Hell, this is almost worth all
the bullshit of dealing with the Brits."
435,2342049,2344092,How is it with those assholes?
436,2344176,2347179,"They're good guys. I just have
to make them think they're in charge."
437,2347262,2351183,"Oh, this is such an honor.
I'm-I'm learning so much."
438,2354811,2357439,"Despite growing tensions
between America and the Soviets,"
439,2357522,2361735,"until this morning, there was essentially
free passage between East and West Berlin."
440,2361818,2363820,"But overnight, without warning,"
441,2363904,2367115,"the Communist authorities
have barricaded off the city."
442,2367199,2371244,"In response, President Kennedy has vowed
to increase America's military presence,"
443,2371328,2375332,"directly speaking with General Clay
who is stationed in Berlin."
444,2385717,2388679,"Grev, would you think it's safe
to keep going to Moscow?"
445,2388762,2393475,"- Yes, certainly. It's fine.
- Even with all this?"
446,2393558,2396770,"That's in Berlin, darling.
Nowhere near Moscow."
447,2396853,2399815,"Yes, I know where Berlin is,
and I know the Russians"
448,2399898,2402609,"- and the Americans are killing any--
- Please, do let me run my business."
449,2407572,2410701,"Today in the Arctic,
the Soviet Union had a successful test"
450,2410784,2414162,of its Tsar Bomba or King of Bombs.
451,2414246,2416123,"With a yield of 50 megatons,"
452,2416206,2420335,"this is by far the most powerful
nuclear weapon ever detonated."
453,2422546,2424339,I have the figures you were asking.
454,2424423,2426216,Thank you very much. Very helpful.
455,2431221,2434516,"Today, every inhabitant of this planet..."
456,2434599,2437477,"- Just down there.
- ...every man, woman and child..."
457,2437561,2438770,"Right here, ma'am?"
458,2438854,2441189,"...lives under a nuclear sword
of Damocles..."
459,2442190,2444443,hanging by the slenderest of threads...
460,2445527,2449156,"capable of being cut
at any moment by accident,"
461,2449239,2452075,"or miscalculation, or by madness."
462,2453076,2457706,"The weapons of war must be abolished
before they abolish us."
463,2462169,2463879,Do you have anything for me?
464,2469676,2470844,Tomorrow.
465,2513303,2515514,"Sure, I'll get it up to him."
466,2541832,2543625,"- Andrew?
- Yeah?"
467,2543708,2545293,Where are the raincoats?
468,2547128,2550590,"Oh, right."
469,2550674,2552050,Sorry.
470,2552133,2554177,It's fine. The forecast is with sun.
471,2554261,2556346,"No, it's not fine.
What if the forecast is wrong?"
472,2556429,2557514,What if it rains?
473,2557597,2559850,"Well, we'll want to stay
in the tent anyway."
474,2559933,2561643,"- We can read books. It'll be lovely.
- It's not the point."
475,2561726,2563770,"The point is,
I told you to pack the raincoats,"
476,2563854,2566940,"I made myself perfectly clear.
So, why didn't you do it?"
477,2567023,2569150,"Greville, are you certain this is
how you want to start our holiday?"
478,2569234,2571570,"- Answer me!
- I..."
479,2571653,2574698,I... forgot.
480,2574781,2577450,"You forgot?
You know, that's fantastic."
481,2577534,2579411,"I've got a son who's too dumb
to remember something"
482,2579494,2581496,"- as simple as packing the--
- Greville, Greville! Greville!"
483,2585792,2587419,Your father didn't mean that.
484,2591172,2592966,"Shall we start again, hmm?"
485,2608356,2610150,Is he all right?
486,2610233,2615030,He's asleep. It's a good sign.
487,2615113,2616364,Here.
488,2619618,2622787,"- Will you be all right?
- Oh, fine."
489,2626207,2629544,"I really needed this holiday
and it's a good idea."
490,2629628,2631046,Glad we came here.
491,2633340,2635050,It's not just tonight.
492,2636426,2638345,You've been so different lately.
493,2641264,2643016,"Greville, what's going on?"
494,2646895,2650523,"Look, I... I didn't want to tell you
before because I..."
495,2652275,2654486,I didn't want you to be involved.
496,2661618,2666206,"It's the business.
Yeah, we've... hit a bit of a rough patch."
497,2669459,2671795,"That makes sense, doesn't it?"
498,2671878,2672879,Men and money?
499,2672963,2676883,"My God, Colin went almost mad last year
when his job looked the tiniest bit shaky."
500,2676967,2680136,"I wish it made sense,
but it's not just that."
501,2680220,2681262,It's everything.
502,2681346,2684849,"He's exercising all the time
and he's become so..."
503,2684933,2688520,"- energetic in bed.
- That all sounds so awful."
504,2688603,2692399,Poor you.
505,2692482,2695235,I'm so sorry. I shouldn't joke.
506,2696236,2698738,"I know Greville
had an indiscretion once before,"
507,2698822,2700699,"but it doesn't mean
he's having an affair now."
508,2700782,2704911,"Then why is he so secretive with me?
And defensive?"
509,2705912,2708581,"And it's always worse
whenever he comes home from Moscow."
510,2708665,2712502,That's when it all started. Moscow.
511,2712585,2714337,Oh.
512,2715839,2718550,"It might be better
if you didn't have to travel so much..."
513,2719843,2721261,better for our family.
514,2721344,2723972,"Darling, I told you, it's very important.
We need the money."
515,2724055,2725056,"- The money?
- Money, yes."
516,2725140,2726599,We just renewed at the club.
517,2726683,2729728,"And you haven't caught any expenses
and now we're going to a smart restaurant."
518,2729811,2733273,"Really not quite certain
how I'm supposed to respond to that."
519,2733356,2735567,"I mean, why can't we live the good life?
It's why I work."
520,2735650,2737777,"Greville, I'm asking you
to stop going to Moscow."
521,2737861,2740280,"- I'm asking you as your wife.
- Oh, I know what you're thinking."
522,2740363,2743116,"- There is no one else, I swear.
- I forgave you once."
523,2743199,2744743,I never said I would again.
524,2746369,2747954,"Hello, Nina."
525,2748955,2750707,Very nice to meet you.
526,2750790,2752542,She's never seen a foreigner before.
527,2770894,2772562,My wife apologizes.
528,2772645,2774939,We cannot invite you for dinner.
529,2775023,2778485,"To bring a foreigner into one's home,
it is not done."
530,2778568,2781237,It's all right. Quite understand.
531,2790580,2793416,"- You have a lovely family.
- Thank you."
532,2797879,2801341,"Alex... when do you think
you'll be ready to defect?"
533,2801424,2805345,"- It is best if we do not talk about that.
- Is something the matter?"
534,2807430,2810600,Just a bit of trouble at home.
535,2810683,2813311,"One day, you will be able to tell Sheila
what you have done,"
536,2813394,2814687,and she'll be very proud of you.
537,2814771,2816815,That might be a bit too late.
538,2816898,2820360,"Sometimes Vera,
she also struggles with my work."
539,2820443,2823154,"Yes, but your wife married a soldier,
mine married a salesman."
540,2825198,2828493,"You know why my government will not
let you travel outside Moscow?"
541,2828576,2830995,They want to hide the suffering.
542,2834707,2838628,"In the city, life is all right,
but in the country where I'm from..."
543,2838711,2840880,I do not want this life for Nina.
544,2840964,2843758,I want her to be free from the State.
545,2845260,2849055,"Someday, if our work succeeds,
when I feel the danger is over,"
546,2849139,2851224,then I will defect.
547,2851307,2853893,I will bring my family to Montana.
548,2853977,2856396,"- Montana?
- Yeah. I've seen some pictures."
549,2856479,2858898,"It is beautiful, like where I grew up."
550,2860108,2862735,Perhaps I will become a cowboy.
551,2862819,2864487,"You, a cowboy?"
552,2865488,2868783,"- Oh, that I would like to see.
- Yes."
553,2868867,2872120,"You must come and visit,
with your family, please."
554,2872203,2876082,"- I would like that very much.
- I would like that, too."
555,2877542,2880670,- All right. I will.
556,2884757,2886426,- Sir?
557,2886509,2888219,Thank you so much.
558,2907113,2908615,What do you have?
559,2908698,2913369,"I'm seeing references to a lot of new
intel coming from the Soviet Section."
560,2913453,2914787,Can you access any of it?
561,2914871,2917248,No. It's all way above my clearance.
562,2917332,2919626,"But I don't think
it's coming from intercepts."
563,2919709,2922086,It feels like they might have a source.
564,2956871,2959791,"I just don't see it
for them to actually do that,"
565,2959874,2961876,to try and sneak nukes into our backyard.
566,2961960,2964337,"- I mean, it would be--
- It'd be like an act of war."
567,2964420,2966381,Even Khrushchev isn't that crazy.
568,2967382,2970885,"All I can tell you is that Ironbark
wouldn't be in the job he or she is in"
569,2970969,2973096,if he or she were an idiot.
570,2974430,2976557,I hope we take this seriously.
571,2980770,2982730,"Stay on this, guys."
572,2984357,2986359,Work every Cuba source we've got.
573,3072195,3074197,"- Have a good flight.
- Thank you, Alex."
574,3293082,3295626,"Ironbark gave us
camouflage profiles"
575,3295710,3299505,"for different kinds of missile
installations so we could tell 'em apart."
576,3299588,3301590,"As soon as we get some U-2 photos,"
577,3301674,3303968,"we'll know if Cuba's got nukes or not,"
578,3304051,3308514,"and whether Russian missiles
can reach mainland US for the first time."
579,3308597,3310266,Can they get a U-2 in the air?
580,3311267,3314937,"This time of year there's just
too much cloud cover."
581,3315021,3317857,"'Til October, you're all I got."
582,3320443,3321736,Mm-hmm.
583,3321819,3323863,"When I went back to my hotel,
they'd searched my room."
584,3323946,3326073,But they didn't find anything?
585,3326157,3327700,"Obviously.
He wouldn't be here if they had."
586,3327783,3329660,I'm saying he's still in the clear.
587,3329744,3333289,"It could just have been
a routine check which he passed."
588,3333372,3335541,"That's it, Greville, we're pulling you
out."
589,3336542,3339712,"But what about Penkovsky?
I didn't have a chance to warn him."
590,3339795,3341672,"We'll have to find another way
to communicate with him,"
591,3341756,3343841,"- but you don't need to worry about that.
- No, you don't understand."
592,3345593,3347511,That's why he's in danger as well.
593,3347595,3350681,"If the KGB have been looking at me,
they'll be looking at him, too."
594,3350765,3353392,"He's still set to come here
for the trade fair next month, isn't he?"
595,3353476,3355019,"- Yes.
- Then he's all right."
596,3355102,3357855,"If he was under suspicion,
they'd never let him leave the country."
597,3360316,3363361,"But you will still help him
to defect, won't you?"
598,3363444,3366322,"Whatever he likes,
he's more than earned his retirement,"
599,3366405,3370076,"and Greville, so have you.
Outstanding work."
600,3371369,3372578,"Oh, my God."
601,3375998,3377917,"So-so, that's it."
602,3381921,3383381,Cuba. What about Cuba?
603,3383464,3385383,"Do try not to worry
about any of this anymore."
604,3385466,3388302,"Put it all out of your head, best you can."
605,3389470,3391764,Understood.
606,3397770,3400064,"Well, thank you."
607,3404693,3408906,"What the hell are you doing?
We're shutting down Wynne, now?"
608,3408989,3411659,"Please recall,
Wynne is a British national."
609,3411742,3413202,Any fallout from his capture
610,3413285,3415788,"would cause a major embarrassment
for the government."
611,3415871,3418416,"We have to know
what Penkovsky knows about Cuba."
612,3418499,3420042,Which at the moment is nothing.
613,3420126,3423671,"He'll be here next month,
we'll debrief him then. That's all."
614,3460749,3462459,"I'm, uh..."
615,3462543,3465754,I'm closing all the accounts in Moscow.
616,3465838,3469091,"- So, I won't be going anymore.
- All right."
617,3472678,3474889,"- Sure you don't want me to help?
- I'm fine. Thank you."
618,3509798,3513260,"- Papa!
- Nina."
619,3595217,3597553,"This government, as promised,"
620,3597636,3600889,has maintained the closest surveillance
621,3600973,3604977,"of the Soviet military build-up
on the island of Cuba."
622,3605978,3607771,"Within the past week,"
623,3607855,3611150,"unmistakable evidence
has established the fact"
624,3611233,3614778,that a series of offensive missile sites
625,3614862,3619033,"is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island."
626,3619116,3622828,"The purpose of these bases
can be none other"
627,3622911,3625914,"than to provide
a nuclear strike capability"
628,3625998,3628250,against the Western Hemisphere.
629,3629251,3631628,It shall be the policy of this nation
630,3631712,3634965,"to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba"
631,3635049,3637676,"against any nation
in the Western Hemisphere"
632,3637760,3641972,"as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States,"
633,3642056,3647019,"requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union."
634,3647102,3652358,"I call upon Chairman Khrushchev
to halt and eliminate this clandestine..."
635,3732729,3736483,"The Soviets are standing firm,
but JFK is refusing to back down."
636,3736567,3739820,It's out of our hands now.
637,3739903,3741488,Anything could happen.
638,3744199,3745325,"- Telegram.
- Thank you."
639,3761842,3763051,It's time. It's got to be.
640,3763135,3764803,"- Time for what?
- Time to get him out."
641,3764887,3767598,"- Greville, we can't get him out.
- Of course you can."
642,3770767,3774897,"Well, then, what did you mean when you
said you were gonna help him to defect?"
643,3774980,3777691,"Family holiday to East Germany,
crossover in Berlin."
644,3777774,3780444,"To try and smuggle them right out
of Moscow, I wouldn't dream of it."
645,3780527,3782112,But you're MI6 and CIA.
646,3782196,3783864,"I can't get anywhere near Penkovsky now,"
647,3783947,3786492,"so there's no way to coordinate
with him or plan it out."
648,3786575,3788660,"We'd have to kidnap him
and his family off the street."
649,3788744,3790370,It'd be a disaster.
650,3790454,3793749,"And if they won't let them leave,
then what?"
651,3795375,3797252,"It was my idea
to bring you into all this."
652,3797336,3799254,"I never should have done
that to you. I'm sorry."
653,3803842,3805302,"Well, then, that's it?"
654,3809097,3810098,We're just going to abandon him
655,3810182,3812768,"and let the KGB murder him
whenever they get 'round to it?"
656,3812851,3814561,This is a hard truth.
657,3814645,3817981,"But if things were the other way around,
Penkovsky would abandon you."
658,3818065,3819399,"No. No, he would not."
659,3819483,3823362,"He's a professional. We use people.
He would do just what I'm doing now."
660,3823445,3825364,Move on. Go home.
661,3827115,3828742,Go home to your family.
662,3836792,3837793,You're wrong.
663,3839586,3840629,What?
664,3844299,3846593,"You're the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that,"
665,3846677,3850055,"but not Penkovsky.
You've met him once, I know him."
666,3850138,3853892,"He would never leave me to die.
And I'm not leaving him."
667,3853976,3855477,I'm afraid it's not your decision.
668,3855561,3857896,"You said the problem was,
there's no way to coordinate,"
669,3857980,3861942,"to let Penkovsky know about
the escape plan, but there is a way."
670,3862025,3863902,Me.
671,3863986,3865112,I can tell him...
672,3866530,3868073,if I go back to Moscow.
673,3869074,3870075,"- You would do that?
- Yes."
674,3870158,3871368,"No, he wouldn't."
675,3871451,3872828,Because he hasn't entirely lost his mind.
676,3872911,3874580,"James, be a bloody professional."
677,3874663,3877666,"I'm volunteering to bring back the best
source of Soviet intelligence you got"
678,3877749,3881211,"at a time where Russia and America
are on the brink of nuclear war."
679,3881295,3884089,"You talk about using people.
For God's sake, use me."
680,3889636,3891388,"If you go back to Moscow,
I'll go with you."
681,3891471,3892931,At no risk to herself.
682,3893015,3895309,"She'll have diplomatic immunity.
She thinks you're a fool."
683,3895392,3898854,"I will do everything in my power
to get both of you out of there."
684,3898937,3901398,"But I am telling you, don't do it."
685,3920542,3922169,"Oh, I didn't know you were..."
686,3931094,3935140,"I have just one last account to close.
Then I'm finished."
687,3936141,3938644,"- Truly.
- Of course. Yes."
688,3940395,3942230,And where are you staying tonight?
689,3945400,3947277,"A hotel, I think, would be best."
690,3973804,3975430,"- Alex.
- Greville."
691,4028316,4031403,"Hi, I'm Karen Tucker.
I'm the new press attaché."
692,4037409,4040871,"Our assets will take a boat
from Finland to Sosnovy Bor."
693,4040954,4042706,Port security there is light.
694,4042789,4045709,"They'll pick the Penkovskys up,
ferry them back across."
695,4045792,4050213,"I need you to take the van and divert
the KGB when we leave the embassy, okay?"
696,4050297,4053675,"If we can just get the Penkovskys
out of Moscow clean,"
697,4053759,4057554,"- we should be all right.
- Yeah. Okay."
698,4057637,4058930,You're going to do fine.
699,4059014,4062100,"Permanent representatives
of a large number"
700,4062184,4065562,"of member governments
of the United Nations..."
701,4066813,4072778,"to address an urgent appeal to you
in the present critical situation."
702,4073862,4077449,"In the interest of international
peace and security..."
703,4078575,4081995,"all concerned should refrain
from any action"
704,4082078,4088418,"which may aggravate the situation
and bring with it the risk of war."
705,4088502,4089878,"Now, we will explain what to do"
706,4089961,4092631,if a warning sounds when you are at home.
707,4092714,4095425,You must immediately take cover.
708,4095509,4097511,Send your children to the fallout room
709,4097594,4103225,"then turn off the electricity
and the gas at the mains."
710,4103308,4105060,"Do you, Ambassador Zorin,"
711,4105143,4108772,"deny that the USSR has placed
and is placing"
712,4108855,4112275,"medium and intermediate-range missiles
and sites in Cuba?"
713,4112359,4114528,Yes or no?
714,4120659,4123829,"And I'm also prepared to
present the evidence in this room,"
715,4123912,4125831,"which you can all examine at your leisure,"
716,4125914,4128583,"shows three successive
photographic enlargements"
717,4128667,4133338,"of another missile base of the same type
in the area of San Cristobal."
718,4135006,4137592,These enlarged photographs clearly show
719,4137676,4140762,"six of these missiles on trailers
and three erectors."
720,4142973,4145642,And that is only one example.
721,4321860,4323903,Bravo. Bravo.
722,4325739,4326740,Bravo.
723,4327741,4329451,Bravo.
724,4331244,4332370,Bravo.
725,4347260,4349429,"- Hmm!
- Mm-hmm."
726,4367072,4369074,Kennedy has sent the offer.
727,4369157,4374412,"If the Soviets take out their nukes,
JFK will declare publicly"
728,4374496,4378458,"- that the US will stand down.
- Think they'll go for that?"
729,4378541,4381711,"- I really don't know.
- Hm."
730,4402232,4403441,Good luck.
731,4425547,4429425,"- Can I take you to the airport?
- Oh, that would be perfect, thank you."
732,4532237,4535406,"Excuse me, what did they say?"
733,4535490,4539160,"They say, ""We're sorry for the delay."""
734,4539244,4540328,Thank you.
735,4547502,4548670,Vera!
736,4727265,4728850,Mr. Wynne...
737,4731811,4734605,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
738,4734689,4737859,"He said, ""Come with us, Mr. Wynne."""
739,4737942,4739402,"Why, what's going on?
I don't understand."
740,4739485,4742113,"Mr. Wynne, please."
741,4768973,4772143,"The Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics"
742,4772226,4775188,has declared you persona non grata.
743,4775271,4779609,"You are hereby ordered
to leave the country within 24 hours."
744,4833788,4834789,Strip!
745,4835998,4837667,- Strip!
746,4908654,4912533,"One, two, three."
747,4920875,4921876,Thank you.
748,4934930,4936349,You were right.
749,4939226,4940645,"You were right, too."
750,4948069,4949695,We had to try.
751,4963751,4966545,"Mrs. Wynne, I'm James Dobbing
with the Board of Trade."
752,4966629,4969090,"- May we come in?
- Yes, please."
753,4978808,4980768,"- Oh, my God.
- It's absurd, of course."
754,4980851,4982978,"The Foreign Office
is hard at work sorting this out."
755,4983062,4986232,"- But it's a delicate situation.
- Why?"
756,4986315,4989777,"Oleg Penkovsky has been arrested as well,
which is quite serious."
757,4990778,4994448,"The Russians are claiming Greville
was caught up in some sort of..."
758,4994532,4996492,"well, espionage."
759,4997493,4999203,The Foreign Office will be in touch soon.
760,4999286,5000871,"And while this is all being resolved,"
761,5000955,5003082,"The Crown will provide
for you and your son."
762,5003165,5005710,"- It's true, isn't it?
- What's true?"
763,5005793,5008045,"Greville was working
with Penkovsky like they say?"
764,5008129,5009296,"No, no. Of course not."
765,5009380,5010965,"Can I call Greville?
I need to speak to him."
766,5011048,5012425,"- I don't think that's--
- No, I have to-- I have to--"
767,5012508,5015094,I have to tell him that I'm sorry.
768,5015177,5017805,I thought he was...
769,5018806,5021267,"- My God, I've been so stupid."
770,5021350,5023394,"- Mommy?
- Andrew, go to your room."
771,5023477,5025396,"- Who are--
- Andrew, go to your room!"
772,5025479,5026689,I'm a friend of your father's.
773,5026772,5029650,"He told me you have
quite the trophy collection."
774,5029734,5031026,Could you show me?
775,5033446,5035156,"Andrew, please, it's all right."
776,5042538,5045124,"-
- Don't tell me it's not true."
777,5046375,5047752,I know my husband.
778,5049295,5050963,I know he's been acting.
779,5052798,5054592,Don't tell me it's not true.
780,5057928,5059930,There are things I can't say to you.
781,5071734,5076947,"I can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man."
782,5078407,5080493,And he needs you now.
783,5081494,5083746,"He needs your help, Mrs. Wynne."
784,5084747,5088667,"You see, once the Russians
realize Greville is innocent,"
785,5088751,5092630,"your government will be able
to get him home safe. In time."
786,5094507,5097384,But if the Russians do decide...
787,5097468,5100846,"that Greville actually is
some kind of spy..."
788,5103724,5105267,I'm so sorry.
789,5108312,5109897,"So, when you talk to anybody..."
790,5111148,5113859,that means your family...
791,5113943,5117112,"your friends, Andrew,
and especially the press..."
792,5119573,5122827,"you have to tell them that none of this
could possibly be true."
793,5122910,5125371,And you have to be very convincing.
794,5128958,5130334,Can you do that?
795,5135589,5137550,Can you do that for Greville?
796,5144390,5147768,"I can't imagine what Penkovsky
could've confessed to."
797,5156694,5158946,"I-I'm sorry,
I don't know what this is."
798,5160155,5165369,"We know everything. We know that Penkovsky
gave you packages to take to the West."
799,5165452,5168372,"- Well, yes, a few times.
- Then you admit it."
800,5168455,5173335,"Admit what? I didn't know
that I was doing anything wrong."
801,5173419,5176380,"You think stealing Soviet intelligence
wasn't wrong?"
802,5176463,5179800,"If that is what was happening,
I-I didn't know it."
803,5180801,5182720,"I never asked him
what was in the packages,"
804,5182803,5184096,I didn't think it was my business.
805,5184179,5186098,Who did you give these packages to?
806,5186181,5189560,"Well, I dropped them off
in various addresses around London,"
807,5189643,5191604,I-I never thought anything of it.
808,5194481,5195733,Mr. Wynne...
809,5196942,5200654,"You are asking me to believe
that you are very, very stupid."
810,5200738,5203073,"Oh, well, yes."
811,5203157,5207202,"I-I suppose in your world I am,
but, look, I'm just a salesman."
812,5208579,5213250,"I want my clients to like me,
so if that meant doing..."
813,5213334,5217880,"a favor for Penkovsky every now and then,
I really didn't see the harm."
814,5344089,5345049,Hi.
815,5347009,5349678,- Ah! That is so sweet of you.
816,5349762,5352639,"Oh, but I wish I could invite you in,
I'm just..."
817,5352723,5354183,I'm in the middle of 20 things.
818,5354266,5357770,"Oh, no, no. That's fine.
I'm so glad to see you're well."
819,5357853,5359772,"It's been ages, we've all been worried."
820,5359855,5361732,"Yes, well, do say hello for me."
821,5361815,5365069,"Of course. I-I saw that ridiculous
piece in the Mail."
822,5365152,5367696,It's absurd.
823,5367780,5370532,"You don't think there could be
any truth to it, do you?"
824,5370616,5374328,"- What they're saying about Greville?
- Don't be ridiculous."
825,5374411,5378040,"How could Greville ever spy on Soviets?
He couldn't even hide his affair from me."
826,5378123,5379833,"- Right.
- Thank you again for dropping by"
827,5379917,5381543,"- and this was so sweet of you.
- Oh."
828,5381627,5382669,We should have tea.
829,5382753,5384421,"- I'll be in touch. Thank you.
- Yes!"
830,5384505,5387966,"Oh, all right. Bye."
831,5407611,5412908,"For years the Americans have had,
uh, nuclear missiles in Turkey..."
832,5413909,5417037,aimed right at us.
833,5418831,5423001,"Oh, but how dare
we put missiles in Cuba?"
834,5424336,5426880,Is that fair?
835,5426964,5428841,"- I don't know.
- Mm."
836,5429842,5433262,"Do you realize your country
has left you here to die?"
837,5435222,5437599,"No, sir, I don't believe that's true."
838,5453198,5454241,Why?
839,5455242,5457161,Why?
840,5457244,5459329,"Why, for God's sake?!"
841,5460873,5462374,What have I done?!
842,5462457,5465169,I didn't do anything!
843,5466170,5471133,You fucking animals!
844,5547000,5549169,You will not touch. Sit down.
845,5551129,5552297,Sit down!
846,5560055,5561974,"Oh, my God, darling."
847,5563058,5566353,"I know I've been ill,
but I'm on the mend now..."
848,5568897,5570440,and this will help.
849,5571858,5573860,This will help...
850,5573944,5575529,"- very much.
- What are they doing?"
851,5575612,5576947,"What the hell are you people
doing to him?"
852,5577030,5578490,It's not like that.
853,5578573,5581994,"They've been quite respectful
given the circumstance."
854,5583996,5585372,You mustn't fault them.
855,5586707,5588625,Really. You mustn't.
856,5591044,5592504,What you're going through...
857,5593922,5596049,it's all so unfair.
858,5596133,5597718,I'm sorry for what happened.
859,5599553,5601388,I feel wretched for doubting you.
860,5601471,5604308,"No, no. Couldn't be helped."
861,5609521,5615235,"I'm really so glad you're here.
I've missed you both... very much."
862,5616236,5620407,"The foreign office said it's a very good
sign I'm being allowed to visit you."
863,5620490,5623118,"- Mm. Mm.
- They said it might..."
864,5623201,5627331,"it might still take a while yet
to get you home."
865,5627414,5630625,"Since the Russians backed down in Cuba,
they're being very stubborn now."
866,5630709,5632169,What-what happened in Cuba?
867,5632252,5635213,"Well, they removed the missiles.
It's-it's all fine--"
868,5635297,5636673,No more about this.
869,5653482,5655359,And we're trying very hard.
870,5657444,5658820,It might take another...
871,5659821,5663116,it might take another year... or two.
872,5671500,5673543,Tell me something about home.
873,5673627,5676171,Tell me what I have to look forward to.
874,5679383,5683178,"Well, the garden's cooperating a bit.
Finally."
875,5684554,5686973,And we have tomatoes this year.
876,5688350,5690602,"And Andrew, he..."
877,5691686,5694356,"he passed his Maths exam
somehow."
878,5696942,5698443,You'd be proud.
879,5704366,5705742,How are you?
880,5707160,5708286,I'm...
881,5709413,5710705,I'm all right.
882,5711832,5713208,"Really, I..."
883,5715335,5717462,If you can be strong enough for this...
884,5722592,5724136,When you come home...
885,5726430,5728306,I hope we can start again.
886,5736398,5738567,And I was very foolish.
887,5740110,5741403,I'm sorry.
888,5743738,5747993,"But I just want you to know
that every moment I've been here,"
889,5748076,5752706,"I have done nothing but think about
how I'm going to get home to you."
890,5757502,5758587,Really.
891,5763467,5764676,I will.
892,5767304,5769347,I will.
893,5777606,5779357,It's a matter of who.
894,5780609,5782903,We can't send someone of real value.
895,5789743,5790911,Not for Wynne.
896,5790994,5793455,Wynne wasn't valuable?
897,5793538,5795582,"We're all alive, aren't we?"
898,5795665,5798043,He's not an officer is the point.
899,5798126,5800128,"If we propose an officer of theirs,"
900,5800212,5804883,"that sends a message about how we perceive
Wynne, the wrong message."
901,5804966,5808762,"If you let Wynne die over there,
and he will die,"
902,5808845,5810972,"a lot sooner than you think,"
903,5811056,5815560,"no one will ever trust MI6
to protect them ever again."
904,5818647,5820565,You feel guilty.
905,5821691,5822692,I know.
906,5823693,5826738,"But you were doing your job,
and Wynne is our countryman, Emily."
907,5826821,5827822,I promise.
908,5828823,5830116,We'll get him home.
909,5839668,5842087,"If you think Penkovsky
will protect you..."
910,5843088,5845340,you think too highly of him.
911,5847175,5849094,He betrayed his country...
912,5850762,5851972,his family...
913,5853348,5854641,Why not you?
914,5859187,5862023,It is every man for himself. Yes?
915,5880041,5881084,Hi.
916,5884170,5887090,I have not seen a mirror for a long time.
917,5890594,5893096,I like to think I'm still who I was...
918,5894347,5896308,Pretend I am.
919,5898310,5901146,I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.
920,5902856,5905191,"I'm so sorry you're here, Greville."
921,5907861,5911364,I hope you can forgive me for this...
922,5913867,5915785,and for what I had to do.
923,5917370,5919956,"What do you mean,
what you had to do?"
924,5925337,5926838,I held back...
925,5928923,5930342,for as long as I could.
926,5931885,5934512,"I have to protect my family, Greville."
927,5935889,5939434,"To save them,
I had to tell the KGB the truth."
928,5941061,5942437,All of the truth.
929,5947942,5949402,I told them...
930,5951071,5953740,I gave you pictures that...
931,5953823,5956993,helped Americans find missiles in Cuba.
932,5967962,5970006,"And, of course, I told them..."
933,5971091,5973927,"you didn't know what was
in the packages I gave you."
934,5992737,5994072,Greville...
935,5997075,6000829,"I thought I could make
the world a safer place..."
936,6004332,6005709,but I failed.
937,6007043,6008420,All this...
938,6010964,6013216,"betraying my country,"
939,6013299,6016428,"my people, it was for nothing."
940,6019347,6020682,Alex...
941,6027981,6030108,Of course I forgive you.
942,6032026,6034696,"I have to look after my family, too."
943,6036281,6040034,"Easier now I know
there's not gonna be a nuclear war..."
944,6041119,6043621,"because Khrushchev
withdrew his missiles..."
945,6043705,6046958,- ...because of you.
946,6047041,6048334,Because of you.
947,6049335,6050879,You.
948,6050962,6054549,"You did it, Alex. You did it."
949,6054632,6057552,You! You did it!
950,6057635,6060305,"Because of you, Alex!"
951,6060388,6061723,You did it!
952,6158653,6160905,Maybe we're only two people...
953,6165201,6167245,but this is how things change.
954,6177046,6179048,It's okay.
955,6179132,6182010,"Daddy, where are you?"
956,6251079,6252455,"Mr. Wynne,
you've just spoken to your wife."
957,6252538,6255291,"What were your first words to her
and what were her first words to you?"
958,6255375,6257377,"Frankly, we were both rather speechless."
959,6257460,6259003,There were no words for a few moments.
960,6259087,6262632,"Do you have any idea
of what you're going to do in the future?"
961,6262715,6266386,"Oh, I want to get back
to my normal business activities"
962,6266469,6268513,as soon as I possibly can.
963,6268596,6270223,"Well, back to the same company?"
964,6271808,6273267,With my own company.
965,6273351,6275311,Will you travel in East Europe again?
966,6275395,6279232,"Oh, now, that is quite a question
which I can't answer today."
