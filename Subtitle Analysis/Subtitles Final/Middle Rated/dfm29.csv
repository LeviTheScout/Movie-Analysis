2,31825,33785,(door closes)
3,33952,36788,(approaching footsteps)
4,41876,43545,Mom?
5,46089,48466,- Kat?
6,49467,52846,Yeah. I'm fine.
7,54264,56266,"Why are you
all dressed up?"
8,56433,58351,What do you mean?
9,61604,63022,What time is it?
10,63189,64649,Almost five.
11,64816,66151,Really?
12,68069,70238,"I need
to get dinner started."
13,78788,81916,"Kat: I was 17 when
my mother disappeared."
14,82083,86129,"Just as I was becoming nothing
but my body, flesh and blood,"
15,86296,88465,and raging hormones.
16,90550,93052,"She stepped out of hers
and left it behind."
17,94429,97015,(ethereal rock music)
18,177512,179931,"(music continues faintly
on headphones)"
19,180098,181975,(knocking)
20,188481,190817,"Hi, Mrs. Hillman.
Ls Phil home?"
21,190984,194487,"No. I'm sorry, Katrina.
He's... he's not back yet."
22,194654,196030,Really?
23,197532,199242,"Supposed to pick
me up from school."
24,199409,202871,"I'm sure he's on his way.
You know how he is."
25,203037,206457,"Uh, w... w... would you like to
come in and... and wait for him?"
26,206624,209711,"That's okay. Just tell him
that I stopped by."
27,209878,211296,I will.
28,211462,212630,"Thanks, Mrs. Hillman."
29,212797,215133,"Oh, no problem, dear."
30,224350,226352,(music continues)
31,248041,249542,(music shuts off)
32,249709,250793,Dad?
33,252170,254172,"What are you doing
home already?"
34,256925,258384,Have you seen your mother?
35,258551,260595,"No, why?"
36,263306,264933,She's gone.
37,265099,268102,"What do you mean
she's gone?"
38,268269,270521,"I came home
and she wasn't here."
39,270688,273775,"She's probably
at the store or something."
40,275401,277195,Her car is in the garage.
41,277362,281324,"Oh my God, stop being so
melodramatic. She'll turn up."
42,281491,285370,"I called everyone.
Nobody's seen her."
43,285536,288665,"Dad, don't worry.
I'm sure everything's fine."
44,290792,292085,Yeah.
45,294045,296047,I'm going to my room.
46,300176,302971,"Yeah, it was weird. She didn't
leave a note or anything."
47,303137,305181,"And dad is totally
freaking out."
48,305348,308184,"- (video game noises)
- Where do you think she is?"
49,308351,310061,Maybe she finally left him.
50,310228,313314,"She's been threatening to
for all these years."
51,313481,317318,"Well, was she, like,
acting weird or something?"
52,317485,319195,No weirder than usual.
53,319362,321614,"Actually, no. Last week
I came home from school"
54,321781,324158,"and I found her sleeping
in my bed."
55,324325,325660,What?
56,325827,328204,"Yeah. Random, Right?"
57,328371,330039,"When she woke up,
she seemed like,"
58,330206,331666,all confused and out of it.
59,331833,333668,"Kat: I think she was still
half in a dream."
60,333835,336045,(video game noise continues)
61,336212,339549,"So, anyways, where the hell
were you today?"
62,339716,342093,"Oh, yeah."
63,342260,344679,"Sorry, I... I was hanging out
at Thomas', and..."
64,344846,347140,Kat: And you were stoned.
65,347306,351519,"(laughs) Uh, maybe."
66,351686,354105,You want me to come over?
67,354272,356592,"Phil: I don't know, I kind of have
a lot of homework to do."
68,356691,358609,"Since when do you give
a shit about homework?"
69,358776,361487,"My mom's been on my case
lately about my grades."
70,361654,364949,"Phil, we haven't had sex in,
like, over a week."
71,366159,367660,I miss fucking you.
72,367827,372040,"Same here, babe.
But, you know what they say."
73,372206,375251,"Absence makes
the heart get stronger."
74,378337,380214,Yeah.
75,380381,381174,(knocking)
76,381340,382820,"Mrs. Hillman: Phil, are you in there?"
77,382925,384093,I'm on the phone.
78,384260,386179,"Mrs. Hillman: Could you come
out here for a minute, honey?"
79,386345,388765,"I heard a strange
noise outside."
80,388931,391809,"You're always hearing
strange noises."
81,391976,394228,"Yeah, I'll be out
in a sec."
82,394395,398483,"I gotta go. My crazy mom
is imagining things again."
83,398649,402779,"Hmm-kay.
Talk to you later."
84,402945,405031,Okay.
85,409494,411287,(insects chirping)
86,417543,419045,"So, no word?"
87,459710,461921,"You think we should
call the police?"
88,465591,467885,"(sighs) I don't want them
coming here"
89,468052,469428,for all the neighbors to see.
90,469595,471556,"Your mother
wouldn't like it."
91,481732,485611,"If we don't hear
anything by morning,"
92,485778,488239,"let's take a drive
down to the station."
93,499417,501085,Mom?
94,501252,504172,(ethereal music)
95,510094,511554,Mom?
96,532617,534285,Mom?
97,536204,537663,"Mom, what happened?"
98,544045,546422,(gasps)
99,554096,556057,"Kat: When I was little,
my mother tried..."
100,556224,558017,to curl my hair.
101,563272,564774,"Oh, well. We tried."
102,566275,568569,"It looks a little fuller,
I suppose."
103,568736,571530,"Kat: She named me Katrina so
that she could call me Kat,"
104,571697,574367,"because she always
wanted a pet."
105,574533,579580,"Come here, Kat. Purr for me,
kitty. Come on. Purr."
106,579747,582124,Purr. Purr. Purr.
107,582291,587213,"(laughs) That's it.
Good, good little kitty."
108,587380,589340,"Kat: For years
I thought I was her pet."
109,589507,592718,(giggles)
110,595596,597807,(giggles)
111,603271,607358,Kat? Kat?
112,611445,613155,Mama?
113,617952,621998,"I'm here, Kat. I'm here."
114,632383,637888,"No more for you. God, you're
getting fatter by the hour."
115,638055,640516,"Kat: My mother always wanted me
to be a sylph,"
116,640683,642518,all lithe and elegant like her.
117,642685,646731,"And when I hit puberty, my body
changed seemingly overnight,"
118,646897,649942,"the bulk melting off like
I was a snowman in the sun."
119,650109,652278,"Only, instead of finally
pleasing her,"
120,652445,654822,"that somehow made her
resent me even more."
121,654989,658951,"- Do you love the boy?
- God, Jesus, you scared me."
122,659118,661829,"How long have you been
standing there?"
123,661996,664498,"Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you."
124,667335,669253,"Well, are you going
to answer my question?"
125,669420,670420,What question?
126,670463,673674,"That boy next door.
Do you love him?"
127,673841,676844,"What are you talking about?
It's none of your business."
128,680431,682808,I don't love your father.
129,682975,684977,"I can't stand him,
as a matter of fact."
130,685144,687271,"What the fuck? Why would
you say that to me?"
131,687438,689315,"Go fuckin'
tell it to someone else."
132,691817,693486,(door slam)
133,694403,696489,(sighs)
134,696655,697740,"Man: So no note, huh?"
135,700659,702787,No. Nothing.
136,705581,708334,"You say she
didn't pack a bag."
137,708501,712671,"Well, nothing seems to be
missing as far as I can tell."
138,719345,721347,"Kat: The detective was the
polar opposite of men"
139,721514,723516,"like my father, and Phil."
140,723682,726560,"He was the kind of man who
carried a gun, got into fights,"
141,726727,730064,"killed things
with his bare hands."
142,730231,731482,Was she depressed?
143,731649,734610,"Was she on any kind of medication,
or taking anything?"
144,734777,736195,"She didn't kill herself,"
145,736362,738906,"if that's what you're
trying to imply."
146,743911,747039,"(sighs) Well,
the good news is that,"
147,747206,750376,"there's no matches at any of
the hospitals or morgue."
148,752002,754296,No evidence of foul play.
149,754463,757675,"However, and I hate to be
the one to tell you this,"
150,757842,762138,"hundreds of wives
go missing every week."
151,762304,765683,"If a woman wants to vanish,
buddy, she can."
152,765850,768060,"Are you saying there's
nothing we can do?"
153,768227,769812,"Oh, sure there is."
154,769979,771981,"I recommend you alert
your friends, your neighbors."
155,772148,774692,"Detective: Tell them to be
on the lookout."
156,774859,777570,"Keep an eye on your bank
account, your credit cards,"
157,777736,779488,for any kind of activity.
158,779655,780698,Got an answering machine?
159,780865,782741,Mm-hm.
160,782908,786287,"Good, keep it on. Your wife
might try to contact you."
161,786454,790958,"Feel free to call me
if anything comes up."
162,804889,808058,(airplane)
163,819862,821405,Dad?
164,824325,826368,Your mother never loved me.
165,830331,832458,"Kat: I didn't know what to say,
because I couldn't remember"
166,832625,836128,"my mother ever looking at my dad
with anything but contempt."
167,836295,837880,Maybe a zillion eons ago
168,838047,840966,"when they were young,
it was different."
169,841133,847806,(ethereal music)
170,847973,850059,"It's perfect, right?"
171,852269,854438,"It's everything
I've ever wanted."
172,854605,856815,"Kat: She was tall,
stunning,"
173,856982,858943,like a movie star.
174,859109,861862,"They were the
quintessential American couple,"
175,862029,866784,"the future unfurling before
them like some endless magic carpet."
176,866951,868869,"If homemaking was an art
or science,"
177,869036,871789,"my mother would
have won a Nobel Prize."
178,871956,873707,"But once the house
is immaculate,"
179,873874,875834,"and everything was in its place,"
180,876001,877169,she had nothing left to do
181,877336,880005,"but plan the emptiness
of days to come."
182,880172,883884,"And gradually, the beautiful
woman she once was"
183,884051,888889,"became no more than a phantom,
wandering away in a snowstorm."
184,891392,893269,"Hello, sweetheart.
What's for dinner?"
185,893435,895521,"- Meatloaf.
- Oh, yum."
186,895688,898482,"Your meatloaf
is the cat's meow."
187,898649,900401,"So anyway, Do you remember
that ticket"
188,900568,901902,I bought at the office raffle?
189,902069,904947,"- Not really.
- Well, guess what? I won."
190,905114,908576,"- It's a crock pot.
- We don't need a crock pot."
191,908742,910035,What are you talking about?
192,910202,911870,"These are the latest thing.
Everyone's getting one."
193,912037,916083,"You can make, uh, stews,
pot roast, chili."
194,916250,918168,"Well, I don't have time
to fuss with it now."
195,918335,920588,I have to finish dinner.
196,920754,923966,"Just put it out of the way. Over
there, on top of the fridge."
197,926218,927678,Kat: He was her doormat.
198,927845,931223,"She treated him like shit
and he let her."
199,931390,933559,"So imagine my shock
when I visited my father"
200,933726,937021,"at work one day
and discovered he had game."
201,937187,938814,Every woman there was into him.
202,938981,941150,"Flirting with him, batting
their eyelashes."
203,941317,945446,"Good morning, Mr. Connors.
And who is this pretty young lady?"
204,945613,948157,"Good morning, Mindy. This is
Kat, the new receptionist."
205,948324,951160,"- (laughs)
- Kat: I was stunned."
206,951327,954997,"These women actually
thought my dad was hot."
207,955164,957958,"But to my mother,
he would always be pathetic."
208,958125,960753,"A constant reminder
of the unbearable repetition"
209,960919,964590,and dullness of her life.
210,964757,967051,"My parents' marriage was like
a long drink of water"
211,967217,968761,from a frozen fountain.
212,968927,972139,"So cold it turns your teeth
to diamonds."
213,972306,974767,"It was hardly a surprise
to learn their sex life sucked."
214,977603,982566,"Meanwhile, My father had
his own drawer of secrets."
215,988197,990157,"So they just went on
like that."
216,990324,993994,"My mom never coming, my dad
jacking off in the basement,"
217,994161,997122,"all the while pretending
everything was fine."
218,997289,998749,"That we were the perfect
family"
219,998916,1001377,living this perfect fucking life.
220,1018894,1021063,Pass the butter.
221,1029154,1031699,Thank you.
222,1031865,1034076,"Kat: There were times when
I thought she was going mad,"
223,1034243,1035869,"that she was going
to suffocate my father"
224,1036036,1037204,"one night with a pillow,"
225,1037371,1040416,"that she was going to burn
the fucking house down."
226,1040582,1043794,"But instead, she vanished."
227,1043961,1047005,"Woman: How does that
make you feel?"
228,1047172,1048549,I don't know.
229,1048716,1051009,You don't know?
230,1051176,1055347,"- Do you miss her?
- No. Not really."
231,1055514,1057514,"Kat: My dad made me see
a shrink because he thought"
232,1057599,1060352,"I needed to process my feelings
about my mother leaving."
233,1060519,1064273,"Thing is,
I didn't have any feelings."
234,1064440,1067234,"Dr. Thaler reminds me of an
actress playing a therapist."
235,1067401,1071113,"And when we have a session, I
feel like an actress playing myself."
236,1071280,1075576,"I, I act... I have been having
kind of weird dreams lately."
237,1075743,1079788,"Kat: A bad actress.
Doing a shitty job."
238,1079955,1085002,"Like, I'm, um, I'm driving
through this gnarly snow storm"
239,1085169,1087629,"and I can't see anything,
I mean, there's snow everywhere."
240,1087796,1090549,"And then out of nowhere,
this figure appears."
241,1090716,1093510,"I can't, like, make it out
in any detail or anything,"
242,1093677,1096597,"but I just somehow know
that it's my mother."
243,1096764,1099933,"And I try to swerve, but I can
feel the car hit something."
244,1100100,1101727,"I get out,
and I look all around"
245,1101894,1104605,"but there's no body, nothing."
246,1104772,1109818,"Just snow and blinding
whiteness everywhere."
247,1109985,1112738,"I... I've been having these
dreams ever since my mom left."
248,1112905,1114156,"That's not unusual,"
249,1114323,1117910,"especially given the trauma
of your situation."
250,1118076,1120120,"However,
contrary to popular belief,"
251,1120287,1123207,"dreams don't necessarily
mean anything."
252,1123373,1125959,We all have strange dreams.
253,1126126,1128212,"But in most cases,
it's just your brain's way"
254,1128378,1130839,"of letting off steam
at the end of the day."
255,1132049,1133467,Oh.
256,1136220,1138305,"Phil: I'm worried
about you, Kat."
257,1138472,1140682,What do you mean?
258,1140849,1143894,"This is too much
to deal with on your own."
259,1144061,1146271,"Is that shrink
you're seeing helping any?"
260,1146438,1149483,"I guess. I've only been
a couple of times."
261,1150943,1152778,"Yeah, well, my mom said"
262,1152945,1155197,"therapy helped her a lot
after my dad left."
263,1162454,1164998,"I still don't understand
how she could do this to you."
264,1165165,1169461,"- She wanted out, I guess.
- So? That's no excuse."
265,1171296,1173966,"Least my dad told us
he was leaving."
266,1174132,1179304,"He didn't just leave us
in the dark, wondering."
267,1179471,1185102,"Whatever. Can we just
stop talking and fuck?"
268,1185269,1188355,"Gotta get back
before my mom freaks out."
269,1188522,1190691,"Plus isn't your dad
coming home soon?"
270,1190858,1193026,"No, not for
at least an hour."
271,1193193,1195779,"Yeah, well, last thing I want
is for him to catch us again."
272,1195946,1199408,"Last time he got so mad I
thought he was gonna kill me."
273,1199575,1201159,(both sigh)
274,1201326,1204454,"Just, give your shrink
a chance, will you?"
275,1204621,1206206,All right.
276,1206373,1209710,"Seriously. You need to
let some of your anger out."
277,1209877,1213755,"You're gonna crack.
Just like your mom."
278,1213922,1216592,It's like a vicious circus.
279,1219386,1221221,Catch you later.
280,1225017,1227644,(rock music playing)
281,1227811,1229104,"I don't mean to sound crass,"
282,1229271,1232482,"but if I don't get some dick
soon I'm going to explode."
283,1232649,1234818,"Join the fucking club,
sister."
284,1234985,1237529,"Look on the bright side.
At least you've had real sex."
285,1237696,1238947,I'm so paranoid about AIDS
286,1239114,1241450,"I have to live vicariously
through you."
287,1241617,1243857,"Okay, well, the problem is that
once you've had real sex,"
288,1243952,1246496,"it's, like, all
you can ever think about."
289,1246663,1248040,"And Phil barely
even touches me anymore."
290,1248206,1250542,"He, like, gives me
goodnight peck and that's it."
291,1250709,1252336,What? That's fucked up.
292,1252502,1254463,"I know. It's, like,
we're some old married couple."
293,1254630,1257299,"Maybe you should bang that hot
detective you're so into."
294,1257466,1260594,"What? What are you talking
about? He's, like, 40."
295,1260761,1262387,"That's not even legal
I don't think."
296,1262554,1264890,"Kat, he's a cop. If anyone knows
how to do shit"
297,1265057,1266850,"without getting caught, he does."
298,1267017,1269561,"Yeah, plus you'll be 18
in a few weeks anyway."
299,1269728,1273732,"Okay, whatever. (Laughs) I am
not screwing a 40 year old cop."
300,1273899,1276401,"Okay? (Laughs) Back
to the problem at hand,"
301,1276568,1277653,getting Phil to fuck me.
302,1277819,1279738,"Well, have you talked
to him about it?"
303,1279905,1284743,"I tried. All he says is that,
uh, he's got a lot on his mind,"
304,1284910,1287621,"and that I need
to cut him some slacks."
305,1287788,1290540,"Oh my God,
what a fucking moron!"
306,1290707,1294086,"I know. I know Phil's not the
brightest crayon in the box."
307,1294252,1297255,"That is the understatement
of the century."
308,1297422,1299633,"That's what I kind of like
about him, you know?"
309,1299800,1303178,It's just simple.
310,1303345,1304465,"I know that sounds perverse,"
311,1304471,1306390,"but he's kind of like my dad
in that way."
312,1306556,1310352,"You can scratch the surface
and there's just more surface."
313,1310519,1313146,(laughs)
314,1313313,1315857,I'm gonna get straight Cs!
315,1318193,1319987,Show me.
316,1324408,1326827,"My God,
you're so fuckin' crazy!"
317,1326994,1329746,(horn honks)
318,1329913,1333125,"Kat: Phil is literally
the boy next door."
319,1333291,1335544,"And when he and his
mother moved in last year,"
320,1335711,1338088,I instantly despised him.
321,1338255,1340465,"He was so dull
and stupid."
322,1340632,1345762,"I made fun of him. Even earned
a special nickname: Garbage."
323,1347597,1352019,"But then, one night that
summer, everything changed."
324,1352185,1354813,(Goth music plays)
325,1357566,1358859,"Me, Beth and Mickey,"
326,1359026,1361319,"We were doing what we did
every Wednesday."
327,1361486,1363280,"And even more bored
than usual."
328,1363447,1366199,"Sometimes I wish someone would
burn this place to the ground"
329,1366366,1367993,"so we didn't have
to come here anymore."
330,1368160,1369327,"Oh, tell me about it."
331,1369494,1371371,"Every week it's the same
fucking people"
332,1371538,1372914,with the same fucking songs
333,1373081,1375250,"in the exact same
fucking order."
334,1377252,1380464,"- Oh my God.
- What?"
335,1380630,1382758,"Look what the bats
dragged in."
336,1384009,1386595,"Beth: What the hell
is Garbage doing here?"
337,1386762,1388638,"Mickey: Oh, shit,
he's coming over here."
338,1388805,1390265,"Beth:
What a fucking freak."
339,1390432,1393018,"Guys, be cool. Come on."
340,1397439,1400984,". HEY-
. HEY-"
341,1403028,1405155,"You live across
the street from me."
342,1405322,1407115,Mm-hm.
343,1407282,1408282,I'm Phil.
344,1408283,1410952,I'm Kat.
345,1412245,1415582,"This is, uh,
Beth and Mickey."
346,1415749,1417042,Hey.
347,1420462,1423507,This place seems cool.
348,1423673,1424841,Mm-hm.
349,1427094,1429137,You come here a lot?
350,1429304,1430972,Sometimes.
351,1434267,1435852,(new song plays)
352,1440232,1442818,"Is this your
first time here?"
353,1444486,1446154,Uh-huh.
354,1450700,1452327,I love this song.
355,1454329,1456123,Me too.
356,1461586,1463672,"Hey, do you wanna dance?"
357,1466258,1467759,Sure.
358,1508800,1511636,(music continues)
359,1511803,1514806,"(screaming
and machine gun fire)"
360,1527819,1530447,(school bell rings)
361,1541041,1542481,"Wait, what if
your parents come home?"
362,1542500,1544878,"It's my mom's shopping day
and my dad's at work."
363,1545045,1546963,(giggles)
364,1561269,1562854,You sure?
365,1565065,1566066,Yeah.
366,1575242,1578078,Ow. (Giggles) Sorry. Oops.
367,1578245,1579663,Okay.
368,1588213,1589589,You okay?
369,1589756,1592592,Yeah. Okay. (Panting)
370,1592759,1594594,"(moaning) Oh, God."
371,1594761,1600475,"Kat: And like that, in a blink,
my virginity disappeared."
372,1600642,1603103,Just like my mother.
373,1603270,1605146,(knocking)
374,1605313,1608692,"Mrs. Hillman:
Hold on. I'm coming."
375,1617534,1619286,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Hillman."
376,1619452,1621162,"It's Eve Connors,
from next door."
377,1621329,1624874,Oh. Hello.
378,1625041,1626793,"Do you have a moment?
May I come in?"
379,1626960,1630755,"Yes, of... of course.
Ls... is everything all right?"
380,1630922,1631965,Everything's fine.
381,1632132,1635552,"I just thought we should
have a little chat."
382,1635719,1639931,"Oh, please, sit."
383,1640098,1645103,"Can I get you a cup of tea,
or coffee, Mrs. Connors?"
384,1645270,1647188,"No, no thank you."
385,1647355,1649524,"And please, call me Eve."
386,1651234,1653570,So...
387,1653737,1657157,"what can I help
you with, Eve?"
388,1657324,1659951,"Well, it seems my daughter Kat
and your son are dating."
389,1660118,1665332,"Yeah, I know. They're going to
some big fancy dance next week."
390,1665498,1668376,"- Fall formal.
- Ah, the... that's... that's it."
391,1668543,1671171,"Phil is, he's so excited."
392,1671338,1673673,"I thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted,"
393,1673840,1676760,"so I wanted
to introduce myself, and..."
394,1676926,1678720,Whoa. Whoops.
395,1678887,1680430,Phil?
396,1680597,1682098,"Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was here."
397,1682265,1685810,"Phil, this is Kat's mother,
Mrs. Connors."
398,1685977,1687729,". Hey.
- (Laughs)"
399,1687896,1691191,"She just, uh, came by
to say hello."
400,1691358,1694986,"Uh, okay."
401,1695153,1698239,"Well, I'm just gonna
head to my room."
402,1706081,1707916,He's a nice boy.
403,1708083,1710585,"You can rest assured, Eve,
that my Phil"
404,1710752,1712629,"will take good care
of your daughter."
405,1712796,1717842,"He's rented a tux, (laughs)
and everything."
406,1718009,1719135,Yes.
407,1721304,1725058,"I'm taking Kat to the mall
this afternoon to buy a new dress."
408,1727102,1729062,"Dr. Thaler: If your mother
was so unhappy,"
409,1729229,1731398,"why do you think she married
your father in the first place?"
410,1731564,1735068,"(laughs)
God, I have no idea."
411,1735235,1738738,"(laughs)
Because he was there?"
412,1738905,1742325,"Kat: I mean,
he wanted to marry her."
413,1742492,1744869,"She had no
other choice, maybe?"
414,1745036,1747288,"I mean, she went to college,
and she was working as a receptionist,"
415,1747455,1750417,"but what else was
she gonna do?"
416,1754629,1755797,I guess life with my father
417,1755964,1758633,"must have been pretty bleak
and miserable for her."
418,1760635,1761970,In the weeks before she left
419,1762137,1764013,"I noticed that she started
dressing different."
420,1764180,1766975,"What do you mean,
different?"
421,1767142,1771396,"Like, her clothes
got tighter. Sexier."
422,1771563,1774649,"I mean, she even bought
a miniskirt. (Chuckles)"
423,1774816,1777176,"Then there was that night that
she walked in on me and Phil."
424,1779070,1780697,"I think it's time
for Phil to go home."
425,1780864,1783241,"- What? Why?
- It's late."
426,1783408,1785994,It's not even midnight.
427,1786161,1790748,"Kat, what I say goes.
And I say go to bed."
428,1790915,1793376,"Kat: The weirdest part was that
she had on this nightgown"
429,1793543,1795128,that was practically see-through.
430,1795295,1798089,"It was almost like
she was putting on a show."
431,1798256,1800383,"Could it be that's
what she was doing?"
432,1800550,1802969,What? Putting on a show?
433,1803136,1805763,"(laughs)
For me, or for Phil?"
434,1807974,1809934,No.
435,1810101,1812395,I think she was just bored.
436,1812562,1816649,"And getting older, and trying
to get whatever attention she could."
437,1819777,1822739,"It was almost like she wanted to have
an affair or something."
438,1825450,1827952,"Do you think that's
what was going on?"
439,1828119,1831247,"No. I mean,
I can't imagine it."
440,1831414,1835293,"But, I guess anything's
possible, right?"
441,1835460,1837337,Phil: Oh. Sorry.
442,1839422,1841758,"I tried knocking
but there was no answer."
443,1841925,1845929,"That's all right. Could I help
you with something?"
444,1846095,1849891,"I'm just looking
for my mom's stupid cat."
445,1850058,1852310,Have you seen him?
446,1852477,1855480,Can't say that I have.
447,1855647,1859192,"Oh. Okay. Sorry to
bother you, Mrs. Connors."
448,1859359,1864405,"(laughs) Mrs. Connors sounds
so formal. Call me Eve."
449,1864572,1867242,Oh. All right.
450,1867408,1868910,"You know, the time when
I was your age"
451,1869077,1871329,doesn't seem so far away to me.
452,1874207,1877919,"Well, I should probably
look for my mom's cat."
453,1880547,1883716,"Phil, would you like to have
dinner with us tonight?"
454,1883883,1886219,I'm making crab thermador.
455,1888388,1890807,"Uh, sure."
456,1892183,1894352,Dinner is at seven.
457,1894519,1898189,"Cool. Thanks, Mrs. Connor.
I mean..."
458,1899774,1901067,Eve.
459,1915873,1918543,(phone ringing)
460,1918710,1921070,"(Theo) Uh, yeah, you've reached
Detective Theo Scieziesciez."
461,1921087,1922922,"Leave a message
after the beep."
462,1923089,1924757,(beep)
463,1924924,1928469,"Hi. Um, Detective.
It's, uh, it's Kat Connors."
464,1928636,1930513,"I'm just... I'm just
calling because I think"
465,1930680,1934142,"I might have
some information"
466,1934309,1936603,about my mother. Uh...
467,1973014,1974849,(knocking)
468,1982398,1985985,"Hey. Thanks again
for meeting me here."
469,1986152,1987472,"Couldn't bear the thought
of going"
470,1987487,1988655,"into the office
on my day off, you know?"
471,1988821,1990073,(laughs) No problem.
472,1990239,1991908,Come on in.
473,1992075,1994702,Thank you.
474,1996954,1998539,"It ain't fancy,
but it's home."
475,1998706,2001459,(laughs)
476,2001626,2004045,"- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, sure."
477,2004212,2006381,"I'd offer you a beer,
but you're not of age."
478,2006547,2008633,I'd take one anyway.
479,2008800,2010635,All right then.
480,2015098,2016683,Sit down.
481,2036536,2038705,"- Go on.
- Thanks."
482,2042917,2047171,"So? What do you want
to talk to me about?"
483,2048923,2051134,"I, um..."
484,2051300,2055138,"I... I called because
I have some new information."
485,2055304,2058224,"I just remembered
some things, and,"
486,2058391,2060768,"I think my mother may
have been having an affair."
487,2060935,2062353,Oh: Yeah?
488,2062520,2065815,"I mean, it could explain
why she left, right?"
489,2067775,2071237,"Maybe. I'll look
into it on Monday."
490,2072196,2073781,Okay.
491,2077410,2080163,Is that it?
492,2080329,2083416,"I just thought that it might be,
like, relative to the case."
493,2090757,2092258,Are you nervous?
494,2093843,2098389,"(laughs) I guess.
A little."
495,2098556,2102435,"Well, you know you can leave
any time you want, right?"
496,2102602,2104312,I know.
497,2105438,2108691,"But, uh, you don't want
to leave, do you."
498,2112695,2115072,"Because you came here
to seduce me."
499,2117533,2121746,"Well, congratulations,
sweetheart. It worked."
500,2122997,2124582,I'm seduced.
501,2127043,2128836,And how old are you?
502,2129003,2130254,Eighteen.
503,2130421,2132799,"You're not a virgin,
are you?"
504,2132965,2134675,(laughs) No.
505,2136427,2139222,"So, uh..."
506,2139388,2142892,"you know what's about
to happen, right?"
507,2143059,2145728,"And are you sure
that's what you want?"
508,2148856,2153528,"Because I'm not one of your punk
classmates from school, you know?"
509,2153694,2155321,I know.
510,2166707,2169252,"Well, you're hot,
that's for sure."
511,2170711,2173214,Your tits are perfect.
512,2174966,2178219,"But you already know that,
don't you."
513,2183015,2185393,"Maybe I should come over
there and join you."
514,2187395,2188896,Yeah.
515,2199866,2201784,This better?
516,2201951,2203369,Mm-hm.
517,2216173,2218551,"Why don't you take
this top off, huh?"
518,2243242,2245828,Fucking amazing.
519,2254128,2256088,Is this what you want?
520,2256255,2257590,Yeah.
521,2280321,2282490,"- Hey.
- What?"
522,2286702,2288287,Everything all right?
523,2288454,2291040,"Yeah. I just don't sleep
so good sometime."
524,2292500,2294669,"I've seen a lot
of bad shit."
525,2295920,2297630,Dead people.
526,2297797,2299632,Very unhappy about it.
527,2299799,2301717,Oh yeah?
528,2301884,2303344,Yeah.
529,2305137,2307640,"Trust me,
you don't wanna know."
530,2307807,2309225,Try me.
531,2311978,2313896,All right.
532,2316732,2321320,"Once there was
this obese man,"
533,2324115,2327243,"some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline"
534,2327410,2329996,and lit him on fire.
535,2330162,2334667,"And by the time
we got to the body,"
536,2334834,2336877,"two days later,"
537,2338629,2340381,he was still burning.
538,2340548,2341882,What?
539,2343551,2346345,"Guy had so much body fat,"
540,2347596,2349682,"he was like
a human candle."
541,2355479,2358357,"And there's
one thing I've learned,"
542,2358524,2361986,"in all my years as a cop,"
543,2364363,2369660,"it's that people are capable
of doing horrible,"
544,2369827,2372705,"unimaginable things
to each other."
545,2377835,2380671,Love how slippery you are.
546,2380838,2382757,"Feel like I could break you
in half."
547,2382923,2384759,"(laughs) I'm tougher
than I look."
548,2384925,2386552,"- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah."
549,2386719,2388971,"- Wanna try me?
- (Laughs) Yes."
550,2389138,2392224,"- (alternative rock music)
- Oh, my God."
551,2392391,2394310,What? It was easy.
552,2394477,2396353,"What do you mean
it was easy?"
553,2396520,2399690,"I mean I went over there
and I fucked him."
554,2399857,2402401,Wow. I'm impressed.
555,2402568,2405654,"Truly, truly impressed.
So was it hot?"
556,2405821,2408616,"Oh, hell yes.
Like, so much better than Phil."
557,2408783,2409783,"Deets, girl, deets."
558,2409867,2412244,"He's just, like, so manly."
559,2412411,2416749,"Like, cock, and balls, and, like,
hairy chest, and muscles, and,"
560,2416916,2420503,"like, the way he smells, Beth,
is so intense. It's, like, primal."
561,2422004,2423798,"Oh, I can still
smell him on me now."
562,2423964,2425966,"- Oh, my God, let me smell..
- (Laughs)"
563,2426133,2428511,"Oh, God, that's so hot."
564,2428677,2430930,"One day I hope some
musky macho stud"
565,2431097,2432417,will fuck the shit out of me too.
566,2432515,2436936,"- Oh, it'll happen.
- Oh, yeah. When? When?"
567,2437103,2439438,I'm so proud of you.
568,2439605,2442566,"Why? Because I fucked
an old guy?"
569,2442733,2444151,Yeah.
570,2444318,2446278,"I mean, don't take this
the wrong way, Kat,"
571,2446445,2447863,but for the longest time
572,2448030,2449824,"you were acting like
you were still fat."
573,2449990,2451617,"Oh my God.
What are you talking about?"
574,2451784,2454161,"I mean, you lost all
of that weight, like,"
575,2454328,2456163,"what, three years ago?"
576,2456330,2459083,"But you're still skulking
around all angsty and awkward."
577,2459250,2462294,Like a fat chick. Like me.
578,2462461,2465881,"And Mickey, who's basically
a fat chick in a skinny gay body."
579,2466048,2467633,(laughs)
580,2467800,2471637,"- You're crazy.
- It's true."
581,2471804,2472721,"(on answering machine)
Mr. Connor,"
582,2472888,2475008,"this is Sheryl from the
Lorna Linda Police Department."
583,2475141,2478686,"I'm pleased to inform you that
you passed your lie detector test."
584,2478853,2482314,"Thank you for your cooperation,
and have a nice day."
585,2482481,2484900,(beep)
586,2485067,2487653,"Why would your dad need
to take a lie detector test?"
587,2487820,2489738,I have no idea.
588,2489905,2492199,"Well, do you think the cops
think he knows something?"
589,2492366,2495119,"My dad? Beth,
have you met him? (Laughs)"
590,2495286,2498581,"Look up clueless in the dictionary
and there's a picture of him."
591,2498747,2500947,"- Must be some kind of mistake.
- (Squeaking car brakes)"
592,2501041,2503085,Probably.
593,2504461,2507423,"I think that's his car.
Just ask him."
594,2507590,2510634,"- Do you want me to leave?
- What? No. Whatever."
595,2510801,2512011,I'm sure it's nothing.
596,2512178,2513846,(door closing)
597,2514013,2516599,"(sighs)
Hi, sweetheart, Beth."
598,2516765,2520060,"Kids didn't spend too much money
at the mall, I hope?"
599,2520227,2523355,"Nope. I just picked up
a few things."
600,2525065,2527568,"Hey, dad, there was a,
uh, message for you,"
601,2527735,2532364,"on the machine,
from the police department."
602,2532531,2534074,"Is there news
about your mother?"
603,2534241,2538621,"No. They said that you passed
the lie detector test?"
604,2538787,2541665,"Oh. Well, whoop-dee-do."
605,2541832,2543584,"So, you going to join us
for dinner, Beth?"
606,2543751,2545836,"I... I don't think so,
Mr. Connors."
607,2546003,2547838,Hm.
608,2548005,2550049,"Dad, why would they want you
to take a lie detector test?"
609,2550216,2553510,"Beats me. It's standard procedure
in cases like this, I guess."
610,2555846,2558515,"So what are you feeling,
sweetheart?"
611,2558682,2560935,"Should we order takeout
from that rib place?"
612,2561101,2563103,"Yeah, sure."
613,2574031,2575699,Mom?
614,2578035,2580955,"What is it?
What's going on?"
615,2582331,2584291,Is Phil a good fuck?
616,2586168,2587962,"Go to bed, mom."
617,2588128,2590047,"Don't you turn
your back on me!"
618,2590214,2592508,"Seriously,
just go back to bed."
619,2592675,2595219,"I will not be dismissed
by the likes of you."
620,2595386,2597137,"- Answer me!
- Ow!"
621,2597304,2599348,Is Phil a good fuck?
622,2599515,2602935,"What would you know
about fucking, anyway?"
623,2604603,2606313,"Oh my...
what are you doing?"
624,2606480,2608023,What is this?
625,2608190,2609870,"- Mom, what are you...
- Why are you naked?"
626,2609900,2613195,"I was hot! Jesus!
Get out of my room!"
627,2613362,2614738,Why are you doing this?
628,2614905,2618075,"What did I ever do
to you? Stop!"
629,2619576,2622413,"I do too know what
a good fuck is."
630,2623580,2625249,You little slut.
631,2627459,2630713,"What is your problem?
(crying)"
632,2630879,2635384,"Are you insane?
What is fucking wrong with you?"
633,2643225,2645894,"Dr. Thaler: What kind of mother
would do something like that?"
634,2648564,2650190,My mother.
635,2652109,2656113,"What? What?
That's just how she was."
636,2656280,2658907,"I mean, everyone has
a crappy childhood."
637,2659074,2660326,It's not like she beat me.
638,2660492,2664705,"So my mom wasn't Hallmark Card
perfect. So fucking what?"
639,2668709,2671086,"I just think
she was lonely."
640,2674298,2676467,"I used to catch her
staring at me,"
641,2676633,2680304,"like I was wearing something
that I had stolen from her."
642,2682973,2685059,"You look like I looked
when I was you."
643,2685225,2686894,What?
644,2687061,2690981,"I mean, you look like
I looked when I was your age."
645,2691148,2693484,"Whatever, lurker."
646,2696028,2698322,What? What do you want?
647,2700199,2702493,Nothing.
648,2702659,2706622,"Oh my God, stop gawking at me.
You're creeping me out."
649,2706789,2709833,"Just, like, get out of here.
Just leave me alone."
650,2718008,2721345,"About a week
before she disappeared,"
651,2721512,2725099,"Phil and I were in the basement
doing homework,"
652,2726517,2728227,"just like any
other ordinary night."
653,2728394,2729603,(rock music playing)
654,2729770,2732356,(heels clicking on stairs)
655,2732523,2735150,"Mrs. Connor: Well, what
do you think? You like?"
656,2735317,2738070,"Pretty sexy for 42, huh?"
657,2738237,2739613,"Mom, what are you doing?"
658,2739780,2743158,"Oh, loosen up,
Miss Prissypants."
659,2743325,2748038,"Phil. Why don't you and your
mother join us for dinner?"
660,2748205,2751250,"I'm making my world-famous
Beef Wellington."
661,2751417,2755254,"Uh, yeah, o...
okay, Mrs. Connors. I'll ask."
662,2755421,2757089,Splendid.
663,2759174,2761593,I'm in the mood for celebrating.
664,2761760,2763637,(rock music continues)
665,2763804,2765722,"Okay, mom, whatever.
We get it already."
666,2765889,2767641,"Oh, what's the matter, Kat?"
667,2767808,2772354,"Can't stand seeing your mother
have a little fun for a change?"
668,2772521,2774648,"Mr. Connor:
Honey, I'm home!"
669,2774815,2778986,"Oh, and the party is over
before it's even begun."
670,2779153,2781363,"Sweetheart, where are you?"
671,2781530,2784491,"There you are.
What's for dinner?"
672,2787077,2789455,"What's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?"
673,2789621,2791081,What? You don't like it?
674,2791248,2793000,No. I don't.
675,2793167,2795919,"Well, tough shit.
You don't like this skirt?"
676,2796086,2797963,"- Eve, stop it.
- I don't care."
677,2798130,2799840,"(sing-song) You don't like
this skirt and I don't care."
678,2800007,2801567,"You don't like this skirt
and I don't..."
679,2801675,2804303,Get your goddamned hands off me!
680,2804470,2809892,"I'll wear whatever the hell
I want. Whenever I want to!"
681,2810058,2811685,What are you doing?
682,2811852,2814438,"What I do every fucking night
of my fucking life,"
683,2814605,2816899,making your fucking dinner.
684,2820194,2823530,"- (coughs) Oh, Jesus!
- (Coughs) Oh, shit! What reeks?"
685,2823697,2825991,The meat. It's all rotten.
686,2826158,2827576,Must have come unplugged.
687,2827743,2829703,"Don't just stand there,
plug it back in!"
688,2829870,2831872,"Smells like a fucking
dead body in here!"
689,2841798,2845761,"Well, looks like we're
going out for dinner tonight."
690,2845928,2847638,Wanna get Chinese?
691,2847804,2851808,"No. I don't want
fucking Chinese."
692,2853602,2857189,"Okay, then, what would make you
happy, Evie? What do you want?"
693,2859107,2861109,I don't want this.
694,2861276,2864530,I don't want any of it.
695,2864696,2868116,"You, this house."
696,2868283,2869660,Evie.
697,2869826,2872871,"I want my fucking
life back."
698,2875707,2877668,"Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go to dinner."
699,2877834,2881380,"I don't want
fucking dinner!"
700,2881547,2885217,"Why won't anyone
listen to me?"
701,2894268,2897354,(soulful music)
702,2916248,2920586,"Girl: So out of the blue
she was just, like, poof?"
703,2920752,2922337,Kat: Pretty much.
704,2923338,2925465,Girl: Wow.
705,2925632,2928635,"You told me your mom left,
but not like that."
706,2928802,2932889,"Well, we've been roommates
for almost a year, so."
707,2933056,2934182,But don't you wonder where she is?
708,2934349,2935909,"I mean, she's gotta
be somewhere, right?"
709,2936059,2937978,"I don't know, it's weird."
710,2938145,2940105,"Hardly even think
about her anymore."
711,2940272,2942524,"You know, it's, like,
so much time has passed,"
712,2942691,2944901,that kinda just gotten used to it.
713,2945068,2947738,"Guess going home next week
for break"
714,2947904,2951783,"has kinda resurrected
the ghost from my past."
715,2951950,2954119,"Speaking of ghosts,
you're not gonna go see"
716,2954286,2956496,"that loser boyfriend of yours,
what's-his-name, are you?"
717,2956663,2958081,You mean Phil? (Laughs)
718,2960000,2962878,Maybe. Why?
719,2963045,2965380,"Well, you know
I'm team Oliver."
720,2965547,2967466,"We've only been dating
for a couple of months."
721,2967633,2969885,"So? That's enough to know
that he's hot, and smart,"
722,2970052,2972971,"and actually has a future,
unlike what's-his-name."
723,2973138,2976183,"Cindy, you met Phil once,
for a weekend."
724,2976350,2978560,"Yeah, that was enough."
725,2978727,2982814,"(laughs) Whatever.
The future bores me."
726,2984566,2986985,"What's going on with you
tonight? Ls everything okay?"
727,2987152,2989404,"Yeah, why?"
728,2989571,2992032,"I don't know, you seem
a million miles away."
729,2992199,2996787,"Sorry.
Just a little preoccupied."
730,2996953,2998664,I'm fine.
731,3002000,3003335,What?
732,3005003,3006797,Nothing.
733,3006963,3009591,"Don't say nothing
when it's something."
734,3009758,3011843,"Okay, you know I don't
like it when you smoke."
735,3012010,3014130,"It's bad for you, especially
since you're on the pill."
736,3014179,3015972,"Yeah, well, this is only my
second one today."
737,3016139,3017683,"I'm cutting back, just for you."
738,3017849,3021895,"Don't cut back for me. Okay?
It's your health we're talking about."
739,3026066,3027651,"Okay, doctor."
740,3029486,3031029,Are you satisfied?
741,3031196,3032781,"Not if you're
gonna be mad."
742,3032948,3034908,Why would I be mad? Hm?
743,3035075,3036910,"Just because you're
telling me what to do?"
744,3037077,3039246,"I mean, I can't smoke in my room
because Cindy says it stinks,"
745,3039413,3041581,"and I can't smoke around you
because you say it's unhealthy."
746,3041748,3043208,"Kat, it's not like you're
addicted to nicotine."
747,3043375,3044501,You've been smoking for two months.
748,3044668,3047587,"Okay, well, whatever. I just want
to be free to do what I want."
749,3047754,3049798,"Okay, fine.
Go ahead and smoke."
750,3049965,3051842,I don't want to fight.
751,3057013,3059182,"Look, I'm sorry, okay?"
752,3059349,3061184,"I just...
I want you to be happy."
753,3063103,3065772,"- I think I'm just gonna head home.
- Wait. What?"
754,3065939,3067941,"I'm going.
I have studying to do."
755,3068108,3070402,"Kat, come on. What are...
what are you doing? Just stay."
756,3070569,3072487,"Goodnight, Oliver."
757,3074698,3077159,"Oh my God, what is the matter
with you? Seriously?"
758,3077325,3081329,"What did I do?
Kat? Kat!"
759,3081496,3084416,(rock music playing)
760,3113111,3115614,(inaudible)
761,3117032,3119117,"- Hey! Hi, dad.
- (Music shuts off)"
762,3119284,3120285,Wow.
763,3120452,3122746,(laughs) What?
764,3122913,3124581,"I can't believe
how grown up you look."
765,3124748,3127751,"Oh, God. Can we forego
the theatrics, please?"
766,3127918,3131505,"Whatever. Act as jaded as you
want, I missed my little girl"
767,3131671,3133715,"- and I'm not ashamed to say so.
- (Laughs)"
768,3133882,3135842,"So how is Berkeley? Thanks
for all the letters, by the way."
769,3136009,3137409,"Oh, sorry.
Been studying my ass off."
770,3137552,3138595,"I know, I know."
771,3138762,3141848,"You're a big city girl now.
No time for your poor old dad."
772,3144434,3146603,"I'm glad you're home,
sweetheart."
773,3146770,3148814,Yeah.
774,3151858,3153360,"Uh, sh... should we?"
775,3153527,3156446,"Yes. No, I got it.
I got it. Ugh."
776,3156613,3158323,"- Thank you.
- Here."
777,3158490,3160130,"So, anything new
and exciting around here?"
778,3160283,3164371,"Oh, not really.
Much the same old, same old."
779,3164538,3165872,What?
780,3167582,3168750,Dad?
781,3170961,3172921,"Dad, what is it?
Why are you acting all weird?"
782,3173088,3175131,"Well, I do have
a bit of news."
783,3175298,3177217,Is everything okay?
784,3177384,3179928,"Everything's fine.
I just, um..."
785,3180095,3182514,"Oh my God, just spit
it out already."
786,3182681,3186142,I've been seeing someone.
787,3186309,3189312,"- Really?
- Yes. Does that make you angry?"
788,3189479,3191731,"What? Are you kidding me?
No, dad, mom's been gone"
789,3191898,3194067,"a long time. Why shouldn't you
see other women?"
790,3195819,3197696,"Well, good."
791,3197863,3199698,"So, what's her name?"
792,3199865,3201408,"- May.
- May?"
793,3201575,3203660,"She's a sales rep
I met at the office."
794,3203827,3206830,"(laughs)
Dad, that's so great."
795,3206997,3208748,"Seriously,
I'm really happy for you."
796,3208915,3211209,"Thank you, sweetheart.
That means a lot to me."
797,3213420,3215589,"So, what are your plans
while you're at home?"
798,3215755,3217716,"Uh, I have
some studying to do,"
799,3217883,3221553,"but mostly
I just wanna relax,"
800,3221720,3225640,"see some old friends.
You know, the usual."
801,3229102,3232063,"Wow. Welcome back,
stranger."
802,3233773,3235853,"- (alternative music playing)
- Such a fucking rebel."
803,3235859,3237694,"Kat, you're my new idol."
804,3237861,3242032,"(laughs) Oh, my God,
I've missed you guys."
805,3242198,3244318,"I mean, my friends at Berkley
are nice and everything,"
806,3244326,3245869,but just kind of boring.
807,3246036,3248204,"- Oh, I missed you too.
- (Laughs)"
808,3248371,3251333,"What I haven't missed is this shitty
little pisshole of a town."
809,3251499,3253710,"Oh my God, my mom told me
to clean my room this morning."
810,3253877,3255712,"I almost bludgeoned her
to death."
811,3255879,3257505,"Ugh, I can't believe
we ever lived here."
812,3257672,3259132,"Oh, I know."
813,3259299,3262177,"Though I kind of find it reassuring
that this place never changes."
814,3262344,3265055,"You know? It's like
it's frozen in time."
815,3265221,3266431,"- Ew.
- Hm."
816,3266598,3267724,(laughs)
817,3267891,3270477,"And you think
you've changed?"
818,3270644,3272854,"Oh, yeah. I'd say so."
819,3273021,3276107,"I mean, I definitely feel more
comfortable in my own skin."
820,3276274,3278193,"- School's going well?
- Mm-hm."
821,3280028,3283490,"And I assume you haven't heard
from your mother."
822,3283657,3285575,Nope. Not a word.
823,3285742,3288703,"How are you feeling about that?
It's been over two years."
824,3288870,3290914,"(sighs)
I... I don't know."
825,3291081,3293625,"It's... it's kind of gotten
to the point where"
826,3293792,3296419,"I just don't even expect
to hear from her anymore."
827,3296586,3300799,"I've just come to this weird
sort of acceptance of it."
828,3300966,3303009,Guess I've just moved on.
829,3303176,3307138,"I mean, even my dad
has himself a new girlfriend."
830,3307305,3309641,"Does that bother
you at all?"
831,3309808,3312310,Hm-mm. Why should it?
832,3312477,3315438,"My mother's gone.
She's never coming back."
833,3331663,3332872,Hey.
834,3335291,3336584,Hey.
835,3336751,3340463,"How're you doing?
You look great."
836,3342048,3344884,Thank you. You too.
837,3346886,3350056,"Hey, Aaron, okay if
I grab a smoke break?"
838,3350223,3353143,"Make it quick. We got
a fuckload of work to do."
839,3354352,3355812,Come on.
840,3359107,3361067,So school's going good?
841,3361234,3364362,"It's all right. How about you?
How've you been?"
842,3366322,3370201,"You know, work, taking care
of my mom."
843,3370368,3372996,"Same old, same old."
844,3373163,3374998,"- How is she?
- My mom?"
845,3375165,3377042,Yeah.
846,3377208,3379127,Batshit crazy as ever.
847,3386092,3387510,Can I have one?
848,3389220,3393475,Sure. You're smoking now?
849,3393641,3395977,Sometimes. Thanks.
850,3406654,3409157,"When'd you get back
into town?"
851,3409324,3411910,"Um, couple of days ago."
852,3412077,3413995,"I'm sorry, I...
I would have called sooner."
853,3414162,3416623,"Just been
really busy, and..."
854,3418083,3420418,Whatever. It's cool.
855,3426174,3429552,"But, uh, we should, we should
hang out while I'm here."
856,3429719,3432013,"Catch a movie
or something?"
857,3432180,3434724,Yeah. Sounds good.
858,3436392,3438770,Here 'til Thursday.
859,3438937,3440021,Cool.
860,3448363,3451950,"You don't have to,
you know."
861,3452117,3453618,Have to what?
862,3455411,3457288,See me.
863,3457455,3461417,"I mean, I know you might
not have time for an asshole like me,"
864,3461584,3464963,"now that you're a hot
shit college student."
865,3465130,3467757,"Phil, what are you
talking about?"
866,3467924,3470343,"Of course
I want to see you."
867,3470510,3472137,"Right, whatever."
868,3475431,3478309,"I better get back to work
before my boss has a cow."
869,3478476,3479727,Yeah.
870,3490822,3495410,"I am so sorry that I'm late.
Traffic was ridiculous."
871,3495577,3498288,"No problem, sweetheart."
872,3498454,3501124,"Kat, this is May.
May, Kat."
873,3501291,3503334,"I'm so happy we finally
get the chance to meet."
874,3503501,3504627,"I've heard
so much about you."
875,3504794,3508089,"Oh, me too. (Laughs)"
876,3508256,3510592,"And you're even lovelier
than your father described."
877,3510758,3512438,"Oh. (Raspberries)
I'm sure that's not true,"
878,3512468,3513636,but thank you anyway.
879,3513803,3515972,"So how long will you be
in town, Katrina?"
880,3516139,3519851,"Oh, just a week. Then it's back
to the salt mines."
881,3520018,3522145,"Kat got almost all
""A"" s her first semester."
882,3522312,3524355,"Wow, congratulations."
883,3524522,3528193,"Yeah. I lucked out. Have you
guys ordered yet? I'm starved."
884,3528359,3529986,"Your favorite,
the spinach artichoke appetizer."
885,3530153,3532447,"- It's already on its way.
- Oh, yes."
886,3532614,3534574,"I'm going to make a quick trip
to the ladies room."
887,3534616,3536576,"If the waiter comes,
you know what I want."
888,3536743,3538494,"Right, okay."
889,3547128,3550965,"So, uh, are you
all right with this?"
890,3551132,3554093,What? You mean May?
891,3554260,3557222,"Yeah, Dad I like her.
She seems sweet."
892,3557388,3559224,"I just don't want it
to be awkward for you."
893,3559390,3561893,"Dad, I told you I am thrilled
that you met someone."
894,3562060,3564479,"Seriously,
you deserve to be happy."
895,3570026,3572195,"Took off your
wedding ring."
896,3575281,3578284,"It makes May
uncomfortable."
897,3578451,3581412,"I put it back on
when she's not around."
898,3581579,3584165,"Why bother?
I mean, mom left us."
899,3584332,3587543,"She's the one who made
that choice. I accept that now."
900,3587710,3591381,"It's about time
we get on with our lives."
901,3594342,3598054,(water splashing)
902,3604102,3605520,Mom?
903,3609148,3610733,Kat.
904,3610900,3612652,What is it? What's wrong?
905,3612819,3617991,"I put my hands in the water,
and they disappeared."
906,3619075,3620493,What?
907,3622578,3627208,"I was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold."
908,3627375,3630003,"There was a spoon
at the bottom of the sink,"
909,3630169,3635216,"and when I lifted
my hands out of the water..."
910,3648271,3649731,What's the matter?
911,3649897,3651858,"Um, nothing."
912,3653901,3656863,"Just have strange
dreams sometimes."
913,3659115,3661409,Oh yeah?
914,3661576,3663578,Yeah.
915,3665038,3667540,"They started
after my mother disappeared."
916,3667707,3669751,Used to get them all the time.
917,3669917,3673588,"It's actually the first one
I've had in weeks."
918,3673755,3676716,"You hardly ever talk
about your mother."
919,3676883,3679802,"There's not much to say.
She's gone."
920,3682096,3684724,"The shrink says
dreams are meaningless."
921,3686684,3688561,"I don't think
I agree with that."
922,3691147,3693483,"What do you think
my dreams mean?"
923,3704035,3705787,You really want my opinion?
924,3705953,3707914,"Of course.
Why wouldn't I?"
925,3713961,3716881,"As you know, we did an exhaustive
search for your mother."
926,3717048,3720385,"Exhaustive? You guys barely
even looked for her."
927,3720551,3724097,"Actually, a very thorough
investigation was done."
928,3724263,3726682,"We spent over two years
looking for your mom."
929,3726849,3729769,"Not a single trace
was ever found."
930,3729936,3733022,Mm-hm. Whatever.
931,3734899,3736984,"So where do you
think she is?"
932,3740655,3742615,I think she's dead.
933,3745326,3747537,What?
934,3747703,3750706,"Well, you said yourself
she was having an affair,"
935,3750873,3752708,which we confirmed.
936,3752875,3755503,"With your neighbor,
Mrs. Blangman?"
937,3755670,3758423,Mrs. Hillman.
938,3758589,3762927,"Whatever. She said your mom
had a boyfriend."
939,3763094,3765263,How would she know?
940,3765430,3766889,She's nosy.
941,3767056,3768975,She can't see.
942,3773396,3776107,"Wait... whatever. Even if
my mom did have a boyfriend,"
943,3776274,3778192,"doesn't it just make it
that much more likely"
944,3778359,3780445,that she just ran off somewhere?
945,3785533,3788286,"- What?
- Ah..."
946,3788453,3790830,"What? What is it?
What aren't you saying?"
947,3793124,3796002,"We did a thorough background
check on your father."
948,3796169,3799422,Several interviewees told us
949,3799589,3803217,"that he was a pretty jealous
and volatile man."
950,3803384,3806179,My dad is a fucking wimp.
951,3806345,3808306,"That's why he used
to drive my mom crazy."
952,3808473,3810892,"Not according to Bob
and Margie Carlsen."
953,3811058,3813144,"- Who are they?
- Your former neighbors."
954,3813311,3816314,"Your parents used to live next
door to them in Riverside."
955,3816481,3819901,"They told us that when your
father suspected your mother"
956,3820067,3822403,"had a thing
for Bob Carlsen,"
957,3822570,3824989,he lit a trash can on fire
958,3825156,3827825,"and he tossed it
onto their patio."
959,3829535,3832121,"(laughs)
That's ridiculous."
960,3834582,3839170,"Never even heard of these people,
and that was two decades ago."
961,3841589,3843132,"Fine, if my dad was so dangerous,"
962,3843299,3845801,"then why didn't
you ever arrest him?"
963,3845968,3848471,No evidence.
964,3848638,3851724,"We didn't even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant."
965,3851891,3856062,"Asked for my professional
opinion, and I told you."
966,3856229,3859440,"Kat, that's just
what I think."
967,3859607,3860900,Which is?
968,3863653,3865093,"I think you father
caught your mother"
969,3865238,3867532,"fucking her boyfriend
and he killed her."
970,3869033,3871285,"Well, then what did he do
with the body?"
971,3874205,3876332,That's a damn mystery.
972,3889345,3893307,Kat. Come on.
973,3893474,3894934,Where are you going?
974,3895101,3897144,"You know what I think,
Detective?"
975,3898437,3901023,"I think you're
full of shit."
976,3905611,3906821,(door slam)
977,3917290,3920793,"(laughs) Come on, strong man.
You can do better than that."
978,3920960,3922461,"What, like this?"
979,3922628,3925548,(laughs) No. Harder.
980,3925715,3927550,(laughs)
981,3927717,3930636,"Put those muscles to good use
for a change. That's better."
982,3930803,3934890,"That's it. Come on,
give it a whack. (Laughs)"
983,3940771,3942523,You're already here?
984,3942690,3947111,"Uh, yeah. I was just helping
your mom with dinner."
985,3947278,3949196,Unlike some people.
986,3958789,3960666,(knocking)
987,3965713,3969550,"Hi, Mrs. Hillman. It's Kat.
I'm sorry, were you in bed?"
988,3969717,3972928,"Oh, oh no. I...
I was just lying down."
989,3973095,3975890,"I... I haven't been
feeling well."
990,3976057,3978809,"Oh. Well, I'm sorry to bother
you. But, uh, is Phil here?"
991,3978976,3981062,No. He isn't.
992,3981228,3984023,"- Do you know where he is?
- I'm afraid not."
993,3984190,3986525,"That boy sometimes goes out
gallivanting"
994,3986692,3989654,'til all hours of the night.
995,3989820,3992281,"Okay, well, could you please tell him
to call me as soon as he gets home?"
996,3992448,3995159,"- It's kind of important.
- Uh... of course."
997,3995326,3997703,"Thank you. Sorry again
for bothering you."
998,3997870,4002208,"Oh, it's... it's no problem.
Goodnight, dear."
999,4002375,4003959,Good night.
1000,4023896,4025898,"Dad: I don't think it's right
with her here."
1001,4026065,4028025,"May: But if Kat says she's
comfortable, I don't..."
1002,4028067,4031320,"I don't care
what Kat said."
1003,4031487,4033155,Dad?
1004,4033322,4036409,"Honey? Aww, I'm sorry."
1005,4036575,4038452,"I didn't mean
to wake you."
1006,4038619,4040788,"If you two are arguing
over whether or not."
1007,4040955,4043791,"May can sleep over,
it's totally fine."
1008,4043958,4045418,"Sweetheart, I don't think..."
1009,4045584,4047962,"No, no, no, dad, seriously.
I don't mind."
1010,4048129,4051549,"Well, you're sick, and we have to
get you to the airport tomorrow."
1011,4051716,4055970,"I'm almost better. My flight's
not until the afternoon."
1012,4056137,4059390,"You know what, this is my house
and I call the shots around here."
1013,4065646,4068023,"Sorry, Kat."
1014,4068190,4070985,"I didn't mean for you
to get dragged into this."
1015,4076407,4079702,"- (alternative rock music)
- To Phil, may he rest in pieces."
1016,4079869,4081912,"(laughs) Oh, my God,"
1017,4084081,4087084,"No, fuck Phil.
Seriously, fuck him."
1018,4087251,4089336,"The jerk never
even called me back."
1019,4089503,4092173,"That's the spirit.
Fuck Phil."
1020,4092339,4094717,"Or, rather, don't fuck Phil.
Stop fucking Phil."
1021,4094884,4096385,"- (laughs)
- Yeah. Oh!"
1022,4096552,4098804,"Fuck that hot
stud cop instead."
1023,4098971,4101098,Done and done.
1024,4101265,4103058,(all laughing)
1025,4103225,4105506,"You know, he said something
kind of weird the other night."
1026,4105561,4106729,What'd he say?
1027,4106896,4109440,"""I'm gonna plow you
'til you can't walk straight""?"
1028,4109607,4111317,(laughs)
1029,4111484,4115821,"No. Um,
yeah, it was so..."
1030,4115988,4120534,"He said that he thinks
my dad killed my mother."
1031,4124789,4126582,What?
1032,4129710,4130753,What?
1033,4132505,4136926,"I... I told you that, Kat.
Ages ago."
1034,4137092,4138302,We both did.
1035,4138469,4140596,"What are you
talking about?"
1036,4140763,4142973,"It was right after
your mom disappeared,"
1037,4143140,4145643,"and you just didn't
seem to want to hear it."
1038,4145810,4149855,"Remember? I asked if maybe
your dad had something to hide?"
1039,4150022,4151440,You just blew it off.
1040,4151607,4154318,"You said he was too transparent
to hide anything."
1041,4158781,4161200,"You guys
are fucking crazy."
1042,4161367,4163160,(chuckles)
1043,4163327,4166038,(laughs) Yeah. Forget it.
1044,4166205,4168499,"We both watch
way too much bad TV."
1045,4168666,4170793,"But that's why
you love us, right?"
1046,4172878,4174922,"Ugh. God,"
1047,4175089,4177842,"there's nothing more disgusting
than warm, flat champagne."
1048,4178008,4179969,"- Here, give me that.
- What?"
1049,4180135,4182096,"The bottle, please."
1050,4184807,4186267,What are you doing?
1051,4186433,4188352,"It's a trick
I learned at school."
1052,4188519,4190813,"You put the bottle in
the freezer for a few minutes,"
1053,4190980,4194692,"and it is chilled to perfection.
Come and help me."
1054,4204910,4207037,"- Mickey?
- There's no way that I am moving"
1055,4207204,4210583,"a bunch of old, moldy
newspapers. Fuck that."
1056,4210749,4213502,"Get your skinny gay ass
over here."
1057,4214628,4216171,Unh.
1058,4216338,4218465,Get that one.
1059,4219550,4221093,(groans)
1060,4225514,4227766,It's stuck.
1061,4227933,4229476,What the...
1062,4231645,4234690,"Why would you lock
a fucking freezer?"
1063,4234857,4237401,"What the hell is going
on down here?"
1064,4237568,4241947,"Nothing. We're just talking,
and drinking champagne."
1065,4245034,4247286,"Well, it's time
for your friends to leave."
1066,4247453,4250080,What are you talking about?
1067,4250247,4252124,"You heard me, Kat.
The party is over."
1068,4252291,4254585,Are you joking?
1069,4254752,4257212,"Dad, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm a fuckin' adult."
1070,4257379,4259256,"You can't tell me
what to do."
1071,4259423,4261634,"When you're under my roof,
you will do as I say."
1072,4261800,4265054,"And I'm saying your friends
need to go home, now."
1073,4265220,4266805,"Oh my God.
What is your problem?"
1074,4266972,4268599,"Cool it. (Nervous laughter)
It's... it's okay, Kat."
1075,4268766,4270684,"- Yeah. Don't worry about it.
- No..."
1076,4270851,4272978,"Goodnight, Mr. Connors."
1077,4273145,4275147,"Wait, I'll walk
you guys out."
1078,4289328,4292957,"Thank you for completely humiliating
me in front of my friends."
1079,4293123,4296001,"So fucking glad I'm
getting out of here tomorrow."
1080,4298921,4300089,(door slams)
1081,4300255,4303008,"Sorry my dad is being
such a douche."
1082,4303175,4305552,"Whatever. I gotta fly out
early tomorrow anyway."
1083,4305719,4307262,"Me too, and I'm not
even packed yet."
1084,4307429,4309640,Sure you're okay to drive?
1085,4309807,4312059,"Unlike you lightweights,
I can handle my liquor."
1086,4315688,4316855,"God, I'm gonna
miss you guys."
1087,4317022,4319400,"Oh my God, drama queen."
1088,4319566,4322152,"It'll be summer soon, and we'll
be back in this rancid hellhole"
1089,4322319,4324154,for three freakin' months.
1090,4324321,4326407,(all laughing)
1091,4326573,4328450,I know.
1092,4328617,4330494,"Yeah, well, take care.
Don't forget to write."
1093,4330661,4333497,"Yeah. You too, shithead."
1094,4333664,4335416,"Bye, Kat. Have a safe flight,
all right?"
1095,4335582,4336667,- You too.
1096,4380335,4381670,Hey.
1097,4384965,4386341,Hey.
1098,4386508,4390012,"Are you all right?
You look drunk."
1099,4390179,4393682,"Oh, yeah?
Look who's talking."
1100,4396977,4399605,"So you've been avoiding me
on purpose, or what?"
1101,4401940,4405778,"- What do you mean?
- I came by your house last week."
1102,4405944,4408197,"Told your mother
that I needed to talk to you."
1103,4408363,4412743,"Really?
I didn't get the message."
1104,4414244,4416497,"What did you want
to talk to me about?"
1105,4418290,4420793,"Just been thinking
about a lot of things."
1106,4423003,4426423,"You know, I feel like
after my mother left,"
1107,4426590,4428467,"everything changed
between us."
1108,4428634,4432054,"We were different.
You were different."
1109,4434431,4436975,"Everything was different
after that."
1110,4437142,4439269,"Phil, where were you that day?"
1111,4439436,4441480,"You were supposed to
pick me up from school."
1112,4442523,4446151,"I told you.
I was at Thomas'."
1113,4447694,4450072,"My God, don't you get it?"
1114,4450239,4452324,"It doesn't matter anymore.
You don't have to lie."
1115,4452491,4455452,"What do you mean? What makes
you think that I'm lying?"
1116,4455619,4457454,"Okay, I'm not
accusing you of lying."
1117,4457621,4461750,"All I'm saying is whatever it is
that you know, you can just tell me."
1118,4469049,4471301,"You know what? What we had
was sweet, and cute,"
1119,4471468,4476223,"and great and everything, but I think
we both know that it's over."
1120,4476390,4479476,"It's in the past, and I need to know
what happened that day"
1121,4479643,4482354,"so that I can move on
with my life."
1122,4482521,4485941,"Please, Phil, I'm not gonna get
mad at you. I just want to know."
1123,4487734,4491113,"I told you.
I don't know anything."
1124,4493157,4495993,"Was there something going on
between you and my mother?"
1125,4498829,4500497,"- What?
- You heard me."
1126,4500664,4503417,"Were you fucking my mom? Because
some people think that you were."
1127,4503584,4505127,"What... what...
what people?"
1128,4505294,4509423,"Kat, you're... you're drunk.
And crazy."
1129,4509590,4513177,"Phil, I just need to know!
Please, I don't care what it is."
1130,4513343,4515846,"I just cannot keep living
my life in the dark just,"
1131,4516013,4518223,"like, fucking wondering!"
1132,4521768,4523604,"I can't help you, Kat."
1133,4529568,4531195,I'm sorry.
1134,4545626,4547878,"But I will tell you
one thing."
1135,4549755,4552216,"Your dad knows
where she is."
1136,4552382,4554635,"He's been keeping her
up his sleeve this whole time."
1137,4557846,4559264,What do you mean?
1138,4561642,4566021,Don't ask me. Ask him.
1139,4624997,4628750,"Mrs. Connor:
(distant echo) Kat! Kat!"
1140,4628917,4630961,I'm up here!
1141,4632921,4634923,Over here!
1142,4635966,4639511,No! This way!
1143,4639678,4643265,"Yes!
Right in front of you!"
1144,4644599,4647102,"I'm right here, Kat."
1145,4650647,4652899,Help me!
1146,4653066,4656069,"Please! Help me, Kat!"
1147,4659281,4661074,Help me!
1148,4798753,4799963,Kat!
1149,4802424,4804050,What are you doing?
1150,4809347,4810557,Dad?
1151,4813393,4815812,"Do you know
where mom is?"
1152,4828742,4830202,What?
1153,4830368,4833121,Do you know where mom is?
1154,4834581,4837667,"Because Phil says
that you do."
1155,4839961,4843757,"Phil? Your stoner boyfriend
who can't keep a job?"
1156,4854226,4857604,"(sighs) The answer
is no, I don't."
1157,4865779,4867405,Anything else?
1158,4878625,4879918,"Well, clean up this mess."
1159,4880085,4883296,"We have to get you to
the airport in a few hours."
1160,4888385,4890887,(sobbing) Dad?
1161,4895267,4896726,I'm sorry.
1162,4900730,4902190,It's all right.
1163,4913118,4915579,(cries)
1164,4945942,4949321,"So make sure to call so I know
that you landed all right."
1165,4949487,4951072,Okay.
1166,4953825,4956328,"So see you
in a couple of months?"
1167,4959080,4960540,Mm-hm.
1168,4974596,4976306,"I love you, baby."
1169,4983146,4985023,I love you too.
1170,4992864,4994908,I should probably board.
1171,5000997,5002332,See you.
1172,5009422,5011049,"Goodbye, sweetheart."
1173,5046209,5048837,"Kat: That was the last
time I saw my father."
1174,5049003,5052006,"It turns out Beth, Mickey
and Theo were right."
1175,5052173,5056511,"A few weeks after I left, my dad
got shitfaced drunk in a bar,"
1176,5056678,5059097,"and confessed
to killing my mother."
1177,5061307,5065520,"He hung himself
in his jail cell with a sheet."
1178,5065687,5067397,"Before he died,"
1179,5067564,5070191,"he revealed that my mother's body
was in the freezer,"
1180,5070358,5073987,"and that he'd taken it out during
the night while I was sleeping."
1181,5074154,5078158,"He buried her up in the mountains.
Since it'd been frozen for so long,"
1182,5078324,5080702,"her corpse decomposed
freakishly fast,"
1183,5080869,5083538,"turning to liquid
as it melted."
1184,5083705,5087417,"By the time they dug her up,
there was basically nothing left."
1185,5092005,5095216,"I was seventeen
when my mother disappeared."
1186,5095383,5099179,"Like, one day she was there,
cleaning, making dinner,"
1187,5099345,5103767,"and the next...
she was gone."
1188,5105852,5108688,(hums)
1189,5147060,5149813,(grunting)
1190,5166579,5168665,(chuckles)
1191,5168832,5171751,(laughs)
1192,5180510,5182470,Stop it.
1193,5191187,5193273,"Evie, stop."
1194,5197527,5199195,(choke)
1195,5199362,5200613,Evie.
1196,5202198,5203700,Stop.
1197,5205785,5208872,(groans)
1198,5212083,5213793,Please.
1199,5216170,5218089,(cries) Evie.
1200,5219757,5221551,Stop!
1201,5225054,5226347,Stop.
1202,5228182,5230143,(gasps)
1203,5232353,5234606,(exhales)
1204,5238234,5241029,(weeping)
1205,5244866,5248661,(whispering) I love you.
1206,5257378,5260340,I love you.
1207,5262425,5264719,"Kat: Because I never saw
my mother again,"
1208,5264886,5267889,"she remains
in absence to me."
1209,5268056,5270433,An empty space.
1210,5270600,5273686,"An invisible,
half remembered ghost."
1211,5275939,5278191,"So even now I catch
myself thinking"
1212,5278358,5280693,"that I'm gonna run
into her some day."
1213,5280860,5284322,"Like I'll be at a stop light,
and look over at the car next to me"
1214,5284489,5289160,"and there she'll be,
scowling at me with disapproval."
1215,5289327,5293456,"Or I'll spot her across some
crowded street, or train station,"
1216,5293623,5297919,"and we'll run toward each other
like one of those cheesy TV movies."
1217,5298962,5302340,"She'll hug me
like a long, lost lover,"
1218,5302507,5305593,"then take my face
in her long,"
1219,5305760,5308304,"graceful hands,"
1220,5308471,5310848,"look me in the eyes
and say..."
1221,5314727,5316562,"""I'm here, Kat."
1222,5318189,5319774,"I'm here."""
