2,38680,41513,"Sometimes I can still
hear their voices"
3,41560,42959,across Sally's woods.
4,43000,46515,"There was Billy,
Steve, Tommy,"
5,46600,49876,"and the tall kid from
down the street... Joey."
6,49960,51791,"Yeah, it was
Joey Walsh."
7,51880,54189,"My best friend
was Timmy Burns"
8,54280,56874,"who lived two blocks
away from me."
9,58000,60878,"We turned the woods
into a battlefield"
10,60920,65038,"and dreamed that someday
we would become men."
11,72560,73879,Did you hear it?
12,73960,75552,What?
13,83160,85549,"Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!"
14,91680,93511,"Come on, Major!"
15,97800,99950,"They've got to be
somewhere, Ronnie."
16,100040,101519,Watch out.
17,101560,104154,"You've got to stay
in the ravine."
18,104240,105229,Shh.
19,106400,107913,Shh.
20,109760,111512,Go! Go! Go!
21,111600,113318,"Look, there they are!"
22,113360,115112,Wipe them out!

26,120040,121678,Aah!
27,121720,123438,"- Aah!
- Aah!"
28,123480,125630,"You're dead,
and you know it!"
29,125680,127272,"No, I'm not!"
30,127320,129038,Ronnie's dead!
31,129120,131509,"No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!"
32,163760,165398,Look at the mayor.
33,165480,167914,I wonder where your mom is.
34,170400,172311,Where is that woman?
35,172400,174311,Hey!
36,175800,177552,Hi.
37,183440,185476,"3 o'clock,
4 o'clock rock"
38,185520,186635,"5, 6, 7 o'clock"
39,186720,187755,8 o'clock rock
40,187840,190149,"9, 10, 11 o'clock,
12 o'clock rock"
41,190240,192515,"We're gonna rock
around the clock tonight"
42,192560,193788,Put your glad rags on
43,193840,195114,"And join me, hon"
44,195160,197390,"We'll have some fun
when the clock strikes 1:00"
45,197480,200597,"We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight"
46,200680,201510,Donna!
47,201600,203113,"Donna,
come back here!"
48,203200,205077,Get out of the way!
49,206000,208673,"Hey, you boys! Stop that!"
50,208720,209755,When the band slows down
51,209840,211034,We're gonna yell for more
52,211120,212678,"We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight"
53,212720,214551,Donna! Donna!
54,214640,217234,"Stevie Boyer
just gave Mary Barnett a ring."
55,217320,218673,Can you believe it?
56,218760,220159,Over there.
57,220240,221116,O.K.
58,221200,222633,"Come here,
come here."
59,222720,223994,What is this?
60,224080,225479,"Is this
a firecracker?"
61,225520,226475,What's wrong with you?
62,229680,231193,Hey!
63,232120,234156,Hey!
64,244800,246074,This is boring.
65,246160,247991,"Yeah, square, man."
66,257080,259355,"Look, Daddy,
the soldiers!"
67,305560,307516,"Happy birthday,
Ronnie Kovic."
68,307600,308476,For me?
69,308560,309913,Yes. Open it.
70,310000,311353,"That's really
nice, Donna."
71,311440,312793,"Say thank you,
Ronnie."
72,312880,315917,"Thanks, Donna, but
you didn't have to."
73,316000,317638,"Going to
the woods tonight?"
74,317680,319033,"They'll have
fireworks there."
75,319080,320991,"Should be
a real blast."
76,321040,321916,"Yeah, O.K."
77,321960,323598,"What is it?
Open it."
78,323680,325193,Leave him alone.
79,326240,327070,Beautiful.
80,327120,329315,"Hey, it's
the real thing, Ronnie."
81,329400,330753,Feel that.
82,330800,332518,"Just like
Mickey Mantle, Ronnie."
83,332560,334915,"Ain't he
a 4th of July firecracker"
84,334960,336313,in that hat?
85,336360,340353,"Yeah. He's my little
Yankee Doodle boy."
86,340440,343193,"Hey, get it!
Get it!"
87,343240,344719,Come on!
88,344800,346472,Let's go!
89,373880,375279,Did you like it?
90,375360,376713,I don't know.
91,376800,378153,I don't know.
92,378240,381471,"Hey, look how many
push-ups I can do."
93,409320,411072,Wow! Yeah!
94,411120,412109,Yeah!
95,412200,414430,"Come on, Ronnie!"
96,417080,419469,"Go, Ronnie, go!"
97,419560,421869,"Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!"
98,421960,423075,Go!
99,428120,431351,Yes!
100,431400,434915,Yes! That's my boy!
101,435000,436797,That's my boy!
102,441960,443712,Yes!
103,443760,447548,"Ronnie, you made it!"
104,447600,450672,"Yeah, all right!"
105,450760,454230,"Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!"
106,454280,456350,You're going to miss it!
107,456440,458590,Michelle! Barbara!
108,458640,460232,You've got to see this!
109,460320,462834,"Not as a call
to bear arms,"
110,462920,464273,"though arms we need,"
111,464360,466920,"but a call
to bear the burden"
112,466960,468837,"of a long
twilight struggle,"
113,468880,472031,"a struggle against
the common enemies of man..."
114,472080,476790,"tyranny, poverty,
disease, and war itself."
115,476840,479434,"You'll get a licking
if you're late!"
116,479520,482080,"In the long history
of the world,"
117,482120,485157,"only a few generations
have been granted the role"
118,485240,487310,of defending freedom...
119,487400,488719,"Look, President Kennedy,
Daddy."
120,488800,489676,That's right.
121,489760,491113,He's so handsome.
122,491200,493794,"I do not shrink
from this responsibility,"
123,493840,495990,I welcome it.
124,496040,499874,"Let the word go forth
from this time and place"
125,499920,502275,"that the torch
has been passed"
126,502320,504675,"to a new generation
of Americans"
127,504720,507757,born in this century.
128,507840,510434,Let every nation know
129,510480,513950,"that we shall
pay any price,"
130,514000,516230,"bear any burden,"
131,516320,520791,"support any friend,
oppose any foe"
132,520840,522751,to assure the survival
133,522840,524558,"and the success
of liberty."
134,524640,527473,"I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night,"
135,527560,530120,"and you were speaking
to a large crowd"
136,530200,531792,just like him.
137,531880,533199,Just like him.
138,533280,535589,"And you were saying
great things."
139,535680,537477,"And so,
my fellow Americans,"
140,537560,541075,"ask not what your country
can do for you,"
141,541160,544914,"ask what you can do
for your country."
142,545000,547230,Right! Right up!
143,547280,549236,"Get out!
Got to get out!"
144,549320,550639,You got to get out!
145,550720,552073,You got to get out!
146,552160,554594,"Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!"
147,556840,558193,"All right,
hit the ropes!"
148,558280,559793,"Go, go, go!"
149,559880,561359,Hand over hand over hand!
150,561440,563237,"Get those legs
off those ropes!"
151,563320,565436,"Come on, ladies,
let's come down!"
152,565480,566833,Let's come down!
153,566920,568273,That rope is like life!
154,568360,570749,"You grab it
and hang onto it! Next!"
155,570840,573479,I want you to kill!
156,573520,574589,You hear me?
157,574680,575556,"Yes, sir!"
158,575640,576516,Kill!
159,576600,577953,"I want that
conference championship!"
160,578040,579871,"Do you want that conference
championship?"
161,579960,580949,"Yes, sir!"
162,581000,582353,Get up! Heads!
163,582440,584670,"Get them up!
Do you hear me?"
164,584760,587957,"Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!"
165,588040,590395,"I want that
conference championship!"
166,590440,593318,"If you want to win,
you got to suffer!"
167,593360,595237,You want to be the best?
168,595280,597510,"You got to pay the price
for victory,"
169,597600,599477,and the price is sacrifice!
170,599560,602632,"Susanne, no homework
at the table, please."
171,602720,604631,"No, Tommy.
After supper."
172,604680,605556,Dad?
173,605640,606516,Yeah?
174,606600,607999,"Can I come
with you?"
175,608040,609871,"There's the next
conference champion."
176,609960,611359,"Sorry I'm late, Ma."
177,611400,612753,"There's rice
on the stove"
178,612840,614239,"and fruit
in the icebox."
179,614280,615190,I can't.
180,615240,616593,"It's on your diet,
right?"
181,616680,619478,"I got to drop 3 pounds
by Saturday."
182,619560,621391,"Your brother's
a hard worker, Tommy,"
183,621480,623869,"'cause he wants
to be the best."
184,623960,626599,"Win or lose... in school,
in sports, in life..."
185,626680,629478,"as long
as you do your best,"
186,629520,631476,"that's what matters
to God."
187,631560,633790,"Win or lose,
we still love him."
188,633840,635717,"Can I go
to my room?"
189,635760,636670,"Yeah, sure."
190,636720,638551,"Thank you, God,
for this food."
191,638600,642798,"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost, amen."
192,642880,644552,"Daddy, Jimmy
took my doll!"
193,644640,645993,I'll get the doll.
194,646080,647399,I hate his guts!
195,647480,648833,Just go to bed.
196,648920,650273,I didn't take anything!
197,650360,651713,"Where's
your sister's doll?"
198,651800,654553,"Jackie? Why
is Jackie not in bed?"
199,654600,655669,Ronnie.
200,657840,659273,"Where'd
you get this?"
201,659360,661715,"Why are you
in my room?"
202,661800,663552,"Don't change
the subject."
203,663600,666353,"I don't allow Playboy magazine
in this house."
204,666440,667350,Stevie gave it to me.
205,667400,669231,"You have filthy,
impure thoughts!"
206,669320,670753,"God's going
to punish you."
207,670800,673633,"I haven't even looked
at it yet, all right?"
208,673680,676990,"Go to confession. I want you
to tell Father McKenna."
209,677040,679349,"I don't want to see
this filthy magazine"
210,679400,680799,in my house again.
211,680840,682273,"Now, take this away!"
212,682360,683713,What's going on?
213,683800,684676,Nothing.
214,684720,686119,"What do you mean,
nothing?"
215,686160,687912,"Nothing, Dad. O. K?"
216,698280,701192,"You're out of bounds, guys.
Back inside."
217,701280,704238,"Come on, Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic."
218,705400,707630,"Go, Ronnie."
219,707720,710109,"Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic."
220,710160,711479,"Back inside.
Let's go."
221,711560,713437,"I want to see
some explosion!"
222,713480,714879,"Come on, Ronnie!"
223,714920,716512,No messing around!
224,716600,718477,"You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!"
225,718560,719879,Stay with him!
226,719960,721791,"Come on down!
All right!"
227,721880,723711,"O.K. Get off
the mat."
228,723800,725153,"You're going
to get..."
229,727480,729835,"Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!"
230,729920,731433,"Reversal.
2 points!"
231,731520,733590,All right!
232,733640,735392,"Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!"
233,735440,736839,"Ohh, you!"
234,744000,745991,"One, red!
You're both up."
235,748040,750508,"All right, fresh start.
Fresh start."
236,750600,753353,"Stand up.
Don't let him get you!"
237,753440,754793,"Don't
let him get you!"
238,754880,756711,"Pull him out!
All right!"
239,756800,758119,"Watch those legs.
Watch him!"
240,758200,760839,"Get him down!
Don't let him get the neck!"
241,760880,762438,No! No!
242,762480,763993,No!
243,764040,766110,"You can beat him,
Ronnie!"
244,767160,769151,"Come on! Come on!
Come on!"
245,769240,770593,"Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!"
246,773080,775514,Bridge! Bridge!
247,775560,778916,"You can win!
Don't give up!"
248,780800,782438,Aah!
249,787760,790513,"Oh, no!"
250,798800,800358,"O.K., son?"
251,807160,808559,"Oh, no."
252,808640,810596,Come on. Get up.
253,815440,817192,Attention!
254,817280,819157,Forward march!
255,819240,821310,"Left, left."
256,821400,822913,"Left, right, left."
257,828080,829798,Seats!
258,834360,835952,Good morning.
259,836040,838395,"I am Gunnery
Sergeant Hayes."
260,838440,839839,"This is
Sergeant Bowers."
261,839880,843555,"United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York."
262,846480,847993,We are here today
263,848040,851032,"at the request of your principal
Mr Richards"
264,851080,853150,"and other members
of the faculty"
265,853200,856988,"to tell you a little bit
about the Marine Corps."
266,857080,858752,"First off,
young men,"
267,858800,860836,"let's get
one thing straight."
268,862240,866074,"Not everybody becomes
United States Marines."
269,866120,867599,"We want the best,"
270,867680,869989,"and we'll accept nothing
but the best,"
271,870080,871957,"because there
is nothing prouder,"
272,872040,874600,"nothing finer, nothing
standing as straight"
273,874640,877473,as a United States Marine.
274,877560,879551,"Now, they've got the Army."
275,879600,881477,They got the Navy.
276,881560,884120,"They got
the Air Farce."
277,884200,886555,"And if you want
to join them,"
278,886600,887953,be my guest.
279,888040,890474,"But if you want
a challenge..."
280,890560,893632,"if you want to try
something difficult..."
281,893680,896513,"if you want to try to
achieve the impossible..."
282,896600,899398,you try 13 weeks of hell
283,899440,900839,"at Parris Island,
South Carolina,"
284,900880,903838,"and you'll find out
if you got what it takes."
285,903880,907077,"You'll find out
if you really are a man,"
286,907160,910675,"then the Marines may be

Chosin Reservoir."

We have never lost a war."
292,922720,925837,"We have always come when
our country's called us."
293,925920,928115,"Now, Sergeant Bowers and I"
294,928200,930555,"would like to open this up
to questions."
295,930600,933876,"So if any of you young men
do have questions,"
296,933960,936155,"go ahead
and raise your hands."
297,936200,938077,"Come on, now.
Don't be afraid."
298,938120,940475,"Don't forget, a good
Marine's a thinking Marine."
299,940520,941839,"Billy Vorsovich, sir."
300,941920,945196,"When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?"
301,945280,948272,"You can be wearing this
in 13 weeks."
302,948800,949869,Go! Go!
303,949960,951552,"Go, Massapequa!"
304,951640,953949,Go! Go! Go!
305,954000,955718,"- Yay!
- Yay!"
306,959360,960509,"Hi, Donna."
307,962960,964678,Go! Go!
308,964720,966278,"Go, Massapequa!"
309,966320,967469,Go!
310,967560,969357,"My brother's at school
at Adelphi."
311,969440,973274,"He said there will be a war in...
what is it?"
312,973320,974275,Vietnam.
313,974320,976629,"The Marines will be
the first in,"
314,976680,978591,"and it won't
last long."
315,978680,982434,"So if we don't sign up
soon, we'll miss it."
316,982480,984835,"I've already decided.
I'm going in."
317,984880,985790,Really?
318,985840,987239,Just like that?
319,987280,989635,"I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now."
320,989680,990590,You're crazy.
321,990640,992995,"Our dads
got to go to WWII."
322,993080,995878,"This is our chance
to be part of history."
323,995920,997592,"Yeah, just like
our dads."
324,997640,999437,"Think about
what you're doing."
325,1000800,1003109,"It could be dangerous
over there."
326,1003200,1005156,"You could
get yourself killed."
327,1005200,1008192,"Where are you going,
squirrel head? College?"
328,1008240,1010470,"I want to do something
with my life."
329,1010560,1012835,"I can get a degree in
business administration."
330,1012920,1015036,"You don't need
to serve your country?"
331,1015080,1017833,"Don't you care
about anybody but yourself?"
332,1017920,1019273,Better dead than red.
333,1019360,1021669,"They got missiles pointed
at us everywhere. ICBMs."
334,1021760,1023512,"Coming in
all around us."
335,1023560,1024993,"Cuba now.
90 miles away."
336,1025040,1026393,They're taking over.
337,1026440,1027714,When will we stop them?
338,1027800,1029916,"You can't stop them
by yourself."
339,1029960,1031757,"Communism is
moving in everywhere."
340,1031840,1034115,"Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them."
341,1034160,1035513,"They're not here
in Massapequa,"
342,1035560,1037869,"so I'll just take care
of number one."
343,1037960,1039837,"That's right.
Me... Stevie, number one."
344,1039880,1042713,"Someone's got to stay
with the women and children"
345,1042760,1045069,"while the men
go do the fighting."
346,1045160,1047549,"All I'm saying is,
think about it."
347,1047640,1048993,"Think about it,
Ronnie."
348,1049080,1051753,"Stevie, who are you taking
to the prom?"
349,1051840,1053159,Wendy Daniels.
350,1053240,1054116,Wendy Daniels?
351,1054200,1055076,Wendy Daniels?
352,1055120,1056792,He got desperate.
353,1056840,1059229,"Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?"
354,1059280,1063068,"Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?"
355,1063120,1064519,You don't know her.
356,1064560,1066437,"She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma."
357,1066520,1067873,What's her name?
358,1067920,1069069,You don't know her.
359,1069160,1070957,"What's her name,
Ronnie?"
360,1071040,1072359,"Her name
is Lombardi."
361,1072440,1073316,Lombardi?
362,1073400,1074276,Yeah.
363,1074360,1075918,Vince Lombardi?
364,1076000,1077911,Rosanna Lombardi.
365,1077960,1079837,"She's from
out of town, right?"
366,1079880,1081757,"She going
to get a motel?"
367,1081800,1084314,"'Cause I'd like
to get in on that."
368,1089960,1092838,"Ronnie, would you take this
to section three?"
369,1092880,1095235,"Check the stock
for dog food."
370,1095280,1096190,Dog food.
371,1096240,1098117,"Then finish
stacking the potatoes."
372,1098200,1099553,Come on. Let's go.
373,1099600,1102433,"Let's do some work
for a change."
374,1102480,1104357,"This goes
in section three?"
375,1104440,1105316,Section three.
376,1105400,1106594,"O.K., Dad."
377,1130760,1132432,"Hey, Donna."
378,1132520,1133555,"Hi, Ronnie."
379,1133640,1134390,"Hi, Ronnie."
380,1134440,1135077,"Hi, Ronnie."
381,1135160,1137151,"How you doing?
How's..."
382,1137240,1138514,Good.
383,1138600,1141876,"I heard that you were going
into the Marines."
384,1141960,1143109,"Yeah, yeah."
385,1143200,1145509,"It's better than
working at A&P."
386,1145600,1146953,"That's great,
Ronnie."
387,1147040,1148075,That's wonderful.
388,1148160,1149991,"I'm going
to boot camp soon."
389,1150080,1151911,"I joined
for four years,"
390,1152000,1153353,"so I go to Vietnam,"
391,1153440,1155271,"probably on
the front line."
392,1155360,1156429,Really?
393,1156520,1158351,"I'll see
a lot of action."
394,1158440,1159316,Wow.
395,1159400,1161038,That's neat.
396,1161120,1163429,"Heard you got
into that school."
397,1163520,1164555,The letter?
398,1164640,1165675,Yeah.
399,1165760,1167159,"Yeah, Syracuse."
400,1167240,1169151,"It's going to be
really hard."
401,1169240,1172516,"Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?"
402,1172600,1174431,"Oh, yeah. Sure."
403,1178040,1180395,"I've been meaning
to call you."
404,1180480,1181833,"I was wondering,"
405,1181920,1185310,"are you going with
someone to the prom?"
406,1185360,1187078,"Yeah. I'm going
with Jed."
407,1187360,1188554,"Oh, yeah?
That's great."
408,1188640,1191438,"I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed."
409,1191520,1192873,Stevie Boyer told me
410,1192960,1196191,"that you were taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma."
411,1196240,1197639,"Yeah. No, no."
412,1197680,1198669,No?
413,1198760,1201399,"No. I don't have time
for that stuff."
414,1201480,1204278,"There's a lot of things
to take care of"
415,1204360,1206510,"before you go
in the Marines."
416,1206600,1209114,"I didn't even know
how much stuff."
417,1209160,1211754,"Maybe I'll see you
before I leave, O. K?"
418,1211840,1215310,Soldier boy
419,1215400,1219632,"Oh, my little soldier boy"
420,1221440,1229279,I'll be true to you
421,1229320,1234269,You were my first love
422,1234360,1238956,And you'll be my last love
423,1239040,1243716,"I will never
make you blue"
424,1243760,1248390,I'll be true to you
425,1248480,1253156,In this whole world
426,1253200,1254679,"You can love
but one girl"
427,1254760,1256591,"I told you
I love you."
428,1256680,1257908,You promised.
429,1257960,1262033,"Let me be
that one girl"
430,1262120,1266591,"For I'll be
true to you"
431,1271080,1273469,"The batter is
Mickey Mantle."
432,1273520,1274919,Mickey has two strikes
433,1274960,1277269,"and the chance
to put the Yankees"
434,1277320,1278719,ahead in this game.
435,1278760,1280637,"The pitcher
gets his sign,"
436,1280680,1283035,"takes his stretch,
checks the runners."
437,1283080,1284513,Here's the pitch.
438,1284560,1286312,"Mickey swings,
and he connects!"
439,1286400,1289198,"There's a long drive
deep to centre field!"
440,1289280,1290633,"It is going, going!"
441,1290720,1293029,"It is gone
into the bleachers,"
442,1293120,1295270,455 feet away
443,1295360,1298796,"for Mickey's
491st home run!"
444,1298880,1300279,How about that?
445,1300360,1302715,"The crowd is
on its feet,"
446,1302760,1304637,"giving Mickey
a standing ovation."
447,1304680,1306352,And rattle your walls
448,1306440,1311275,"For the times,
they are a-changin'"
449,1311360,1313794,"Come, senators
and congressmen"
450,1313880,1315472,Please heed the call
451,1315560,1317516,Don't stand in the doorway
452,1317600,1320034,Don't lock up the hall
453,1320080,1322355,"For the times,
they are a-changin'"
454,1322440,1323793,"There's absolutely
no question."
455,1323880,1325199,The First Cavalry Division
456,1325280,1328078,"is the latest concept
in mobile warfare."
457,1328160,1329513,One division is worth
458,1329600,1332160,"21/2 Russian
and 6 Chinese divisions."
459,1332200,1334555,"How well will
the individual soldier"
460,1334600,1336511,"stand up here
in Vietnam?"
461,1336560,1340155,"What do you think,
Dad, about that?"
462,1340200,1341474,I don't know.
463,1341560,1342993,"13,000 miles..."
464,1343080,1346197,"that's a long way to go
to fight a war."
465,1346280,1348589,"They fought the French
and the Japanese"
466,1348680,1349874,for 30 years.
467,1349960,1351791,"Can they
be weeded out?"
468,1351880,1353757,"Anything
that lives in a cave"
469,1353800,1355279,can be weeded out.
470,1355360,1359592,"I just hope they send you
to Europe or Korea or..."
471,1359680,1360715,They can't.
472,1360800,1361949,Someplace safe.
473,1362000,1364833,"Every Marine has
a tour of duty there."
474,1364880,1366757,It's not like the Army.
475,1366840,1368193,What's wrong with you?
476,1368240,1370117,"You served.
Uncle Bob served."
477,1370200,1371872,"I know, Ronnie.
I know."
478,1371920,1373831,"Remember what
President Kennedy said?"
479,1373920,1375717,"There won't be
an America any more"
480,1375760,1378069,"unless people are willing
to sacrifice."
481,1378120,1379473,I love my country.
482,1379560,1380436,I know.
483,1380520,1381919,"And you're right,
Ronnie."
484,1381960,1383712,"You're doing
the right thing."
485,1383760,1385478,"Communism has
to be stopped."
486,1385560,1387755,"It's God's will
you go."
487,1387840,1389319,We're proud of you.
488,1389400,1390913,"Be careful,
that's all."
489,1390960,1392678,"Up there in Hanoi,"
490,1392720,1395553,"they don't allow magazines,
newspapers, and televisions"
491,1395600,1398068,"to cast doubts
on the military system."
492,1398120,1401874,"Don't you know what being a Marine
means to me, Dad?"
493,1401960,1403757,"Ever since
I was a kid,"
494,1403840,1406149,"I've wanted
to serve my country,"
495,1406240,1407593,and I want to go.
496,1407680,1409511,"I want to go
to Vietnam,"
497,1409600,1412558,"and I'll die there
if I have to."
498,1413600,1416433,"The attitude of people
on the home front"
499,1416520,1418954,"is very important
in this war."
500,1419040,1421838,"Not a nice night
for the prom."
501,1421920,1423751,"Can the South Vietnamese
government"
502,1423840,1425671,"stand up
to the North?"
503,1425760,1427113,"We wouldn't
be here"
504,1427200,1428679,"if we didn't
think so."
505,1437360,1439635,"Sometimes, God,
I'm so confused."
506,1442480,1444675,"Sometimes
I think I'd just..."
507,1445680,1448513,"like to stay here
in Massapequa"
508,1448600,1450272,and never leave...
509,1452600,1454272,but I got to go.
510,1458920,1460273,"Just help me, Jesus."
511,1460360,1462920,"Help me to make
the right decision."

the lieutenant told me"
681,2035840,2037956,"that was
a pretty rough time."
682,2038000,2040195,"Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad."

685,2044520,2047398,"You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?"
686,2047440,2048509,"Yes, sir."
687,2048600,2051398,"Like I said to the captain,
uh, sir..."
688,2051480,2054278,"it was a very
confusing day."
689,2054360,2055429,The villagers...
690,2055520,2058273,"Yeah. I know about
the villagers, Sergeant."
691,2058360,2059713,"They...
the villagers..."
692,2059800,2061631,"It was very,
very unfortunate."
693,2061720,2063950,"The enemy used
the villagers as cover."
694,2064040,2065075,"Yes, sir."
695,2066120,2068315,"They popped up,
started firing."
696,2068360,2070112,"We were
running back, sir."
697,2070160,2071559,It was real glary.
698,2071640,2072993,"Very confusing,"
699,2073080,2075594,"and that's when
it happened, sir."
700,2075680,2076874,What happened?
701,2076960,2079713,"Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir."
702,2079800,2081950,"Yeah, I know
about Wilson."

704,2083640,2085949,"he was
the last one out,"
705,2086040,2088349,"and that's when
it happened, sir."
706,2088440,2090317,"Sir, I think
I might..."
707,2090400,2092675,"I might have
killed him, sir."
708,2092760,2094113,I don't think so.
709,2094160,2096469,"He was coming up
over the dune."
710,2096520,2099080,"I think I might
have killed him."
711,2099120,2100189,It's hard.
712,2100240,2102800,"I was out a couple
of weeks ago."
713,2102880,2105872,"Sometimes it's... very hard
to tell what's happening."
714,2107720,2108914,"Yes, sir."
715,2110120,2113078,"But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson."
716,2119080,2120877,"I don't think so, Kovic."
717,2120960,2124077,"But, sir, I want you
to know that..."
718,2124160,2125036,Don't talk like that!
719,2125120,2126519,Don't tell me this shit.
720,2126600,2128795,"I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?"
721,2128840,2129750,"Yes, sir."
722,2129800,2130710,That clear?
723,2130760,2131829,"Yes, sir!"
724,2131880,2132915,All right.

they've got to operate."
817,2540560,2542437,"There's something
wrong with me."
818,2542520,2544078,"The doctors
are real busy."
819,2544160,2545991,"There's a lot
of wounded here."
820,2546080,2547593,"There's no time
for anything"
821,2547680,2549398,"except trying
to stay alive."
822,2549480,2551914,"You got to try
and stay alive. O. K?"
823,2552000,2553479,Try and stay alive.
824,2553520,2557479,"I've come to give you
your last rites."
825,2557520,2559636,Are you ready?
826,2560680,2562511,"I'm ready, Father."
827,2566280,2568635,"I am the resurrection
and the life."
828,2568680,2570238,"He that believeth in me,"
829,2570280,2572510,"though he were dead,
yet shall he live."
830,2572560,2574391,"We brought nothing
into this world,"
831,2574440,2576829,"and it's certain
we can take nothing out."
832,2576920,2579753,"The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away."
833,2579840,2582229,"Blessed be the name
of the Lord."
834,2598600,2601239,I got sunshine
835,2601320,2604118,On a cloudy day
836,2605960,2608918,"And when it's
cold outside"
837,2609000,2611719,I got the month of May
838,2611800,2614598,"Eddie, I need
some help in room 13."
839,2614680,2616557,"Give me
a second, man."
840,2616640,2617789,"His catheter's
plugging up."
841,2617880,2620235,"It's backing up
into his kidney."
842,2620320,2622151,I said I'd be there.
843,2622240,2624196,Give me a break.
844,2624280,2625474,"Man, what's going up?"
845,2625560,2626470,"Nothing, man."
846,2626560,2628835,"You ain't supposed
to be having this."
847,2628920,2629955,Oh!
848,2630040,2633350,"Didn't I tell you not
to do that to him"
849,2633440,2634873,in the A. M?
850,2634920,2636956,"Take the needle
out of my arm."
851,2637000,2638274,"Good morning,
Nurse Washington."
852,2638320,2639548,How are you today?
853,2639640,2641949,"You up bright
and early today."
854,2642040,2643109,Everybody up!
855,2643200,2644519,"Good morning, gentlemen."
856,2644600,2646750,Let's rise and shine.
857,2646840,2647716,Peña!
858,2647800,2649631,Can I have some aspirin?
859,2649720,2651073,I ain't feeling well.
860,2651160,2652513,I'd like some aspirin.
861,2652600,2654431,Hmm. I'll get to you.
862,2654520,2656829,"Leon! How you
doing today?"
863,2656920,2658273,Look at this shit.
864,2658360,2659236,Mm-hmm!
865,2659320,2660673,"My catheter's
clogged."
866,2660760,2661988,Give it a minute.
867,2662080,2664230,"They're getting
bigger every day."
868,2664320,2665639,"You don't bother them,"
869,2665680,2667432,"they ain't going
to bother you."
870,2667520,2669317,"That's why
I'm feeding him."
871,2669360,2672158,"Keep on feeding him,
and everything'll be fine."
872,2672200,2674395,"Up and at 'em!
Frankie's here!"
873,2674440,2675839,"Hey, Frankie.
What's up?"
874,2675880,2677598,"Hopkins, come on,
wake up."
875,2677640,2679392,"All you guys,
6:00 special."
876,2679440,2680316,Fuck you.
877,2680360,2682078,"Fenaday,
I'm looking at you."
878,2682120,2683439,Keep looking.
879,2683520,2685238,"My man Kovic.
Up already?"
880,2685320,2686548,That's good. Let's go.
881,2686600,2688318,"Let's do it.
Let's go."
882,2688360,2690430,Give me a hand over here.
883,2690480,2691993,"How you doing,
Eddie?"
884,2698920,2702196,"Yeah, you about ready.
Let me have that thing there."
885,2704720,2706870,"Hey, where did we go"
886,2707760,2710069,Days when the rains came...
887,2710120,2712031,"I think my stomach
is bloated."
888,2712080,2713433,Just take it easy.
889,2713480,2716313,"Eddie going to take care
of all you boys."
890,2716360,2718237,"It's like
a car wash."
891,2718280,2719508,"Bernstein,
what's wrong today?"
892,2719560,2721915,"You got shit up you
ain't coming out."
893,2721960,2724235,"Stick your head up my ass,
see what the problem is."
894,2724320,2726151,"Your piss bag's
cloudy, too."
895,2726240,2728071,"You been drinking
enough water?"
896,2728160,2730469,"You gots to flush
them kidneys every day."
897,2730560,2732278,"Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah."
898,2732360,2733839,"Frankie,
I think I'm done."
899,2733920,2735148,I think I'm ready.
900,2735240,2737196,"Are you fucking
with me again?"
901,2737280,2738429,"You better
chill out."
902,2738520,2740192,"I'm not
fucking with you."
903,2740280,2742111,"I'm not fucking
with you, man."
904,2742200,2743633,My man Kovic!
905,2745120,2747554,Mr 4th of July.
906,2749320,2750514,"Politicians,
protesters, and police"
907,2750600,2752318,are all here in Chicago
908,2752360,2754032,"for the 1968
presidential election."
909,2754120,2755997,"Chicago police tonight
charged the crowd..."
910,2756040,2758235,"Gook-Iovers.
They ought to die."
911,2759320,2760196,Hey! Hey!
912,2760280,2762635,"There he goes, man.
It's Leon."
913,2762720,2763869,Hey!
914,2763960,2765359,Hey!
915,2765440,2766873,Hey!
916,2767000,2768718,"They're coming
through the wire!"
917,2768800,2769789,Hey!
918,2769880,2771711,"Chieu hoy!
Chieu hoy, Leon."
919,2771800,2773028,"They're going
to overrun us!"
920,2773120,2773950,Shut up!
921,2774040,2775268,"They're going
to overrun us!"
922,2775360,2776349,"Hey, John!"
923,2776400,2778868,"Hey, hey, hey,

924,2778920,2780512,"Chieu hoy, man!"
925,2780600,2782431,"Shut the fuck up, Leon!"
926,2782520,2784909,"Hit him with
some morphine."
927,2785000,2788276,"Chicago has an Alice in Wonderland
quality about it."
928,2788360,2790271,"Things are getting
curiouser and curiouser."
929,2790320,2793312,"Everywhere you go, there's a sign
reminding you..."
930,2793360,2796113,"Love it or leave it,
you fucking bastards!"
931,2796200,2797792,"Hey, you ready, Kovic?"
932,2798760,2800398,They're burning the flag.
933,2800480,2802948,"They're fucking burning
the American flag."
934,2803440,2805795,"Come on.
Let's look alive."
935,2805840,2807239,"Looking good.
Looking good."
936,2807280,2809157,"Come on, Kovic.
Real nice."
937,2809200,2811555,"How many
did I do yesterday?"
938,2811640,2812516,Three.
939,2812600,2813476,Three?
940,2813520,2814919,You had enough?
941,2814960,2816359,Let's do seven.
942,2816400,2819198,"There you go.
Let's go for seven, then."
943,2819240,2821595,"Come on, Ronnie.
That a way."
944,2821640,2823995,"Get up there.
Get up there."
945,2824040,2826395,"Keep going.
Come on, fucking Marine."
946,2826440,2828192,"There you go.
Real nice."
947,2828240,2831710,"This'll be the day
that I die"
948,2831760,2833637,"We want
to make one thing"
949,2833680,2835989,"very clear to you, Ron."
950,2836040,2839032,"The possibility of your
ever walking is minimal."
951,2840240,2842549,Almost impossible.
952,2842600,2846388,"You're a T-6, paralysed
from the midchest down."
953,2846440,2848715,"Probably you'll be
in a wheelchair"
954,2848800,2851553,"for the rest
of your life."
955,2853600,2855909,"Do you understand
what I'm saying?"
956,2856000,2858195,"Well, doctor, will..."
957,2858280,2859269,Hmm?
958,2860480,2863756,"Will I ever be able
to, uh..."
959,2863840,2865671,to have children?
960,2865760,2866829,No.
961,2868160,2870958,"No, but we have a very good
psychologist here."
962,2871040,2872029,He's helped...
963,2872120,2874918,"Oh, I'll walk again.
I know I'll walk again."
964,2875000,2876831,"Let me
tell you something."
965,2876920,2878911,"You will never
walk again."
966,2882040,2882950,Let's go.
967,2883040,2884917,Uhh!
968,2885000,2886319,Uhh!
969,2886400,2888709,"You're walking good
in these things."
970,2888800,2891155,"What am I
looking like, good?"
971,2891240,2892559,You're one crazy Marine.
972,2892640,2893993,"So gung ho,"
973,2894080,2895399,but you don't know shit
974,2895480,2897835,"about what's going on
in this country."
975,2897920,2899433,"Fuck you, Willie."
976,2899520,2902273,"It ain't about burning the flag
and Vietnam."
977,2902360,2904191,"Why fight
for rights there?"
978,2904280,2906555,"We ain't got rights
at home."
979,2906600,2908477,"It's about Detroit
and Newark."
980,2908520,2909919,"It's about racism, man,"
981,2909960,2912793,"but you can't get
no job at home."
982,2912840,2916196,"Vietnam's a white man's war,
a rich man's war."
983,2916240,2917639,Where's my money?
984,2917680,2919557,"You got
to read some books."
985,2919600,2921477,"There's a revolution
going on."
986,2921520,2923875,"If you ain't part
of the solution,"
987,2923920,2926070,"then you's part
of the problem."
988,2926120,2929829,"Jesus Christ, Willie.
Just get my chair for me."
989,2929920,2932718,"You got to watch
for her."
990,2932800,2933949,"Oh, man."
991,2934000,2935399,Some good weed.
992,2935440,2936839,Take the bra off.
993,2936880,2938757,"I'll give you
another 10."
994,2938800,2940358,"Why, sure, sugar."
995,2944440,2945316,Like this?
996,2945360,2948670,"Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah."
997,2948720,2949630,Suck on my tits.
998,2949680,2951079,"Honey, anything
you want."
999,2951160,2952036,Shh!
1000,2953040,2953950,Oh!
1001,2954000,2955228,Jesus!
1002,2955280,2959876,I guess you'd say
1003,2959920,2964232,"What could make me
feel this way"
1004,2964320,2965639,My girl
1005,2965720,2966630,My girl
1006,2966720,2967596,My girl
1007,2967680,2970831,Talking 'bout my girl
1008,2970920,2971989,My girl
1009,2979760,2981239,Good.
1010,2981320,2982196,Easy now.
1011,2982280,2983793,Easy now.
1012,2984840,2985716,Very good.
1013,2985800,2986676,"Hey, Doc..."
1014,2986760,2988910,"it's really beautiful
up here."
1015,2989000,2991150,Ha ha ha!
1016,2997160,2999469,"I'm walking
out of here, guys."
1017,2999560,3000959,"You'll see.
Right, Willie?"
1018,3001000,3002353,Right.
1019,3002440,3003350,Easy.
1020,3003400,3005994,"Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right."
1021,3006080,3007957,"O.K. That's enough
for today."
1022,3009640,3010993,"O.K.
Now, good. Good."
1023,3011080,3013913,"Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don't go too far."
1024,3013960,3015313,Don't do too much.
1025,3015400,3017470,"Looking good today.
Looking good."
1026,3017560,3019039,Don't go too far.
1027,3019080,3019956,All right!
1028,3020040,3021951,"Way to go, Kovic."
1029,3022000,3022910,"Amazing, huh?"
1030,3022960,3024837,"Nothing from
the chest down."
1031,3024880,3027713,"It can be done.
It can be done."
1032,3027800,3029313,"Semper fi, motherfucker!"
1033,3029400,3030355,All right!
1034,3030440,3031793,"All right, Harry, man."
1035,3031880,3033677,Keep it going. Let's go!
1036,3033760,3035478,Let's go. Let's go.
1037,3035560,3036629,Let's go.
1038,3036680,3037874,Aah!
1039,3037960,3038836,Oh!
1040,3038920,3039830,Willie!
1041,3039880,3041711,I think I need...
1042,3041800,3043153,Oh! Oh.
1043,3043240,3044639,"Get him up.
Somebody..."
1044,3044680,3046591,"Something snapped.
It's my neck."
1045,3046640,3047550,All right.
1046,3047640,3049039,Just my neck.
1047,3049120,3050758,"Ah, shit! Harry!"
1048,3050800,3052199,Hang on. Hang on.
1049,3052280,3053429,What was that sound?
1050,3053480,3054390,"Oh, shit."
1051,3054440,3055759,What?
1052,3055840,3056829,Oh!
1053,3056920,3058797,"It's fine.
We're doing fine."
1054,3058880,3060199,Is that my bone?
1055,3060280,3062191,"Harry, Harry,
get a doc."
1056,3062400,3063594,Am I O. K?
1057,3063680,3066114,"It's O.K. Everybody, relax.
Harry! Let's go!"
1058,3066200,3067269,"Oh, fuck."
1059,3067360,3069112,"- Shit.
- Fuck."
1060,3185600,3187318,Washington!
1061,3188960,3190791,"Washington,
where the fuck were you?"
1062,3190880,3193189,"I've been pushing
this call button"
1063,3193280,3196078,"and staring at my own vomit
for two hours."
1064,3196160,3198469,"What's the matter
with you fucking people?"
1065,3198560,3200869,"I'm laying
in my own shit."
1066,3200960,3203315,"Why don't you
change the sheets?"
1067,3203400,3204753,This goddamned fucking place.
1068,3204840,3206159,I need a bath.
1069,3206240,3209038,"Don't be raising
your voice to me!"
1070,3209120,3210519,You watch your mouth.
1071,3210600,3212397,Why don't you help me?
1072,3212480,3214311,"What's the matter
with you?"
1073,3214400,3215753,I don't feel right.
1074,3215840,3218149,"I need to see
the doctor now!"
1075,3218240,3219639,He's not available now.
1076,3219720,3221517,I want to see him now!
1077,3221600,3222953,He's always too busy.
1078,3223040,3224393,What's eating you now?
1079,3224480,3226311,"You going off
the deep end?"
1080,3226400,3227753,"We'll amputate
that leg,"
1081,3227840,3229671,"you go on
like this."
1082,3229760,3232069,"Don't put
your hands on me."
1083,3232160,3234515,"I want to be treated
like a human being."
1084,3234600,3236397,"I don't want
any of that shit!"
1085,3236480,3237833,"Trying to
keep me fucking drugged"
1086,3237920,3240753,"so I don't know
what's going on."
1087,3240840,3242159,This is a fucking slum.
1088,3242240,3243559,"We take that leg,"
1089,3243600,3245477,"you're out
in two weeks."
1090,3245560,3246913,I want my leg.
1091,3247000,3248831,"Why?
You can't feel it."
1092,3248920,3251718,"It's my leg.
I want my leg."
1093,3251760,3253159,"Can't you
understand that?"
1094,3253200,3256033,"I want to be treated
like a human being."
1095,3256080,3257957,"I fought
for my country."
1096,3258040,3259393,I'm a Vietnam veteran!
1097,3259440,3261317,"I fought
for my country!"
1098,3261360,3262759,Shut the fuck up!
1099,3262840,3265638,"I should
be treated decent!"
1100,3265680,3268478,"Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,"
1101,3268520,3271592,"or any of these other people.
You got it?"
1102,3271680,3273796,"You can take
your Vietnam"
1103,3273840,3276673,"and shove it up your ass,
you hear?"
1104,3276760,3279149,"No! I don't
need this!"
1105,3279240,3280559,"Hey, you fuck!"
1106,3280640,3283393,"Hey, goddamn you!"
1107,3283480,3284913,Goddamn it.
1108,3285000,3286797,"I am a fucking
Vietnam veteran!"
1109,3288960,3289790,This isn't...
1110,3289880,3290790,Marvin!
1111,3290880,3291710,"Marvin, now!"
1112,3291800,3292710,Marvin!
1113,3292800,3294119,"What's up?
What's up?"
1114,3294200,3295076,"Marvin, look!"
1115,3295160,3296149,"Oh, fuck!"
1116,3296200,3297155,It's off.
1117,3297200,3298599,"It ain't
going to work."
1118,3298640,3299516,Start!
1119,3299560,3300913,"Washington,
get the doctor."
1120,3301000,3302319,Wait a minute.
1121,3302400,3304868,"OK. Yeah.
All right. I will."
1122,3304960,3306279,"How you doing, Eddie?"
1123,3306360,3308157,"Let's see what's
wrong with this."
1124,3308200,3311272,"They tell me if we don't
get this pump working,"
1125,3311360,3314397,"they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg."
1126,3314440,3315839,Do we have another pump?
1127,3315880,3317950,"It's the only one, Eddie."
1128,3318040,3319359,Ron. It's Ron Kovic.
1129,3319400,3321152,"Sorry, man. Ron."
1130,3321240,3323435,You... You are a doctor?
1131,3323520,3325511,"It's the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks."
1132,3325600,3327716,"The government's not giving us
the money we need"
1133,3327760,3329716,"to take care
of you guys."
1134,3329800,3332633,"We're doing our best.
It's really too bad."
1135,3332680,3334033,It's not fair.
1136,3334120,3336634,"I've tried hard
to keep this leg."
1137,3336680,3339558,"I've been strapped in
this bed for four months"
1138,3339600,3341909,"so I could
keep this leg."
1139,3341960,3344315,"Maybe I can rig up
a substitute."
1140,3344360,3348148,"I'll look in the basement
and see what we got."
1141,3348200,3349599,You're coming back?
1142,3349640,3350914,Soon.
1143,3350960,3352996,"Let go, Ron.
Let go."
1144,3354920,3357957,"We really did try
to help Mr Kovic."
1145,3387240,3390630,Aah!
1146,3401000,3402513,"Susanne, he's here."
1147,3402600,3403715,Ronnie's home.
1148,3411080,3412399,O.K. Out on 3.
1149,3412480,3413879,"All right, 1..."
1150,3413960,3414836,2...
1151,3414920,3415716,3.
1152,3415760,3417159,"Oh, that's great."
1153,3417200,3419555,"Did you
paint the house, Dad?"
1154,3419600,3420999,Yeah. I painted it.
1155,3421080,3422433,Yellow. It looks good.
1156,3422480,3423833,It looks pretty good.
1157,3423880,3426599,"I got that.
That's all right. Let's go."
1158,3426680,3428989,"The kids have been
talking about you."
1159,3429040,3431395,"They can't wait
to see you."
1160,3431440,3434352,"It's great to be back
in the neighbourhood."
1161,3434440,3436749,I got it. I got it.
1162,3436840,3439195,"Everything looks
so different."
1163,3440200,3441519,Major.
1164,3441600,3442476,"Hey, Major."
1165,3442560,3444869,"Major, you know
who this is?"
1166,3444960,3445836,Yeah.
1167,3445920,3447751,You know who this is?
1168,3447840,3449193,"He's gotten old, huh?"
1169,3449280,3451111,Just like your old man.
1170,3451200,3452474,"Hey, Tommy."
1171,3452520,3453919,Good to see you.
1172,3453960,3455075,Look at that hair.
1173,3455120,3457475,"Dad lets you
look like that?"
1174,3457520,3459078,"I don't have
much say."
1175,3459160,3460559,"How are you, Jimmy?"
1176,3460640,3463393,"Good to have you home.
You're out for good?"
1177,3463480,3464879,I'm out for good.
1178,3464960,3467155,"Patty, gee,
look at you."
1179,3467240,3468116,Timmy.
1180,3468200,3469030,That's Jackie.
1181,3469120,3469996,Jackie?
1182,3470080,3472674,"I wanted to visit you
in the hospital."
1183,3472720,3475518,"How many pull-ups
you do, huh?"
1184,3475560,3478358,"You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups."
1185,3478440,3480795,"23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K."
1186,3480840,3482558,I'm all right.
1187,3482600,3483555,Ronnie.
1188,3483600,3484510,Susanne.
1189,3484560,3486391,Good to have you home.
1190,3486440,3489159,"You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful."
1191,3489200,3490599,"She's a woman, huh?"
1192,3490640,3491550,I'm sorry.
1193,3491600,3494433,"That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway."
1194,3494480,3495799,I'm only paralysed.
1195,3495880,3497950,You look great.
1196,3498040,3498995,Yeah?
1197,3499080,3501753,Ronnie.
1198,3501800,3502835,Mom.
1199,3503720,3504596,Ronnie.
1200,3504680,3506079,"Hey, Mom."
1201,3506120,3507792,"Oh, look at your hair."
1202,3507880,3509279,It looks great.
1203,3509320,3510673,You like it?
1204,3510760,3512512,"Oh, you look beautiful."
1205,3512560,3513629,Thanks.
1206,3516040,3517871,It's good to be home.
1207,3517960,3519837,"It's better
than seeing me"
1208,3519880,3521233,"at that hospital, huh?"
1209,3521320,3522673,It's O.K.
1210,3522760,3524193,I know.
1211,3524240,3525434,I'm O.K.
1212,3525480,3526708,I'm O.K.
1213,3526760,3529911,"It's good to
have you home, Ronnie."
1214,3529960,3532713,"Gee, everybody
looks so good."
1215,3532800,3534916,Everybody looks so good.
1216,3535040,3538476,"I'm going to go inside
for a minute."
1217,3538560,3539913,"Mom, wait."
1218,3540000,3541319,She'll be O.K.
1219,3541400,3544198,"Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good."
1220,3544280,3545633,"Ronnie,
you look good."
1221,3545720,3546596,Welcome home.
1222,3546680,3548989,"It's so good
to see you."
1223,3549080,3550957,"Welcome home.
Nice to see you."
1224,3551040,3553315,"Look at Harry.
You look good."
1225,3553400,3554310,Welcome home.
1226,3554400,3556277,"Let's go in
the house and help."
1227,3558760,3561069,"Come on, Mom.
It's all right."
1228,3561160,3562036,Looks good.
1229,3562120,3563314,Yeah?
1230,3565480,3566879,You need some help?
1231,3566920,3568273,"No. I'm O.K., Dad."
1232,3568360,3571158,"Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie."
1233,3571240,3573549,Put a wider doorway in.
1234,3573640,3576438,"I built a shower
for you, too."
1235,3576520,3579318,"You can get in here
pretty easy."
1236,3579400,3581709,"Oh, and I
put some handles"
1237,3581800,3583791,"on the toilet
for you."
1238,3584680,3585590,Ronnie.
1239,3585640,3586675,"Thanks, Dad."
1240,3610040,3613828,"It's really great
to be back in my room."
1241,3624000,3626036,It's good to have you.
1242,3627320,3629788,"It's good to have you,
Ronnie."
1243,3637440,3639237,"Come on, I'll show you..."
1244,3640600,3643433,"I'll show you
some new stuff we got"
1245,3643520,3645476,"in the bedroom
over here."
1246,3647880,3650110,"My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months."
1247,3650200,3652998,"My competitor's rushing in to build,
but I was first."
1248,3653080,3654479,The people are loyal.
1249,3654560,3656835,"You probably think
it's just a hamburger."
1250,3656920,3659718,"A patty's
just a piece of meat,"
1251,3659800,3661153,"but it can
have character."
1252,3661240,3662593,See that doughnut hole?
1253,3662680,3665797,"Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16."
1254,3665880,3668189,"Saves me
about $40,000 a year."
1255,3668280,3669395,"That's serious
money, Ron."
1256,3669480,3670833,I plug the hole
1257,3670920,3672797,"with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices."
1258,3672840,3675070,"I cover it
with a pickle."
1259,3675160,3676991,"They'll never
miss a thing."
1260,3677080,3679878,"Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks."
1261,3679960,3681313,Good job. Try this.
1262,3681400,3684233,"You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise."
1263,3684320,3686470,"I got a drive-in
window, too."
1264,3686560,3687913,It's Long Island's first.
1265,3688000,3689831,"It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast."
1266,3689920,3691751,"Feed the family
for $3.95."
1267,3691840,3693193,Check out these chicks.
1268,3693280,3694918,"They're wearing
those new miniskirts."
1269,3695000,3697309,"It's my idea.
It's good for tips."
1270,3697360,3698759,"The customers
always come back."
1271,3698800,3700199,"Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself."
1272,3700240,3703073,"It's no mom-and-pop
operation any more."
1273,3703120,3704519,This is our town.
1274,3705800,3708360,"You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work."
1275,3708400,3709469,Good.
1276,3709520,3710919,"Copiague, Ronnie,
Jericho, Bayville,"
1277,3710960,3712359,"Valley Stream, man."
1278,3712440,3713793,I want to turn Boyer's
1279,3713880,3716189,"into a whole
Long Island thing."
1280,3716240,3718913,"I want you to come
to work for me."
1281,3719000,3720353,What can I do?
1282,3720400,3722277,This is our town now.
1283,3722320,3725153,"You're a war hero,
and you can benefit."
1284,3725200,3726599,"You should benefit,
Ronnie."
1285,3726680,3728033,"You mean, like partners?"
1286,3728080,3729957,"We open a place
together?"
1287,3730000,3732355,"You got to walk
before you run."
1288,3732400,3735233,"I could start you out
as a cashier."
1289,3735280,3737635,"Then you could
learn the business,"
1290,3737720,3739950,"work your way up
to be manager,"
1291,3740040,3741792,just like your dad.
1292,3741840,3744354,"I get 1,700 a month
from the government."
1293,3744440,3745793,I'll take my time.
1294,3745840,3747990,"That's charity money.
This isn't."
1295,3748040,3748916,Charity?
1296,3749000,3749955,Here's your cola.
1297,3750040,3752713,"You got to put
the war behind you."
1298,3752800,3754597,"Forget about
this chair you're in."
1299,3754640,3756039,"Sometimes,
you know, Stevie,"
1300,3756080,3757479,I think people know
1301,3757520,3758919,"you're back
from Vietnam,"
1302,3758960,3761315,"and their face changes,
the eyes..."
1303,3761360,3764193,"the voice, the way
they look at you."
1304,3764280,3766111,"I know, but people here,"
1305,3766160,3768515,"they don't give a shit
about the war."
1306,3768560,3771358,"It's just a million miles away.
It's all bullshit."
1307,3771400,3774198,"The government sold us
a bill of goods."
1308,3774280,3776953,"We got the shit
kicked out of us."
1309,3777000,3780436,"What do you mean ""we""?
You were in college."
1310,3781480,3784278,"It was you who bought
that communist bullshit."
1311,3784360,3787158,"Yeah. They were going
to take over the world."
1312,3787240,3788593,Do you remember that?
1313,3788680,3790033,"Finnelli, you, Walsh."
1314,3790120,3791951,"The whole town
was devastated."
1315,3792040,3793678,For what?
1316,3793760,3794829,For lies?
1317,3794920,3796911,For bullshit lies?
1318,3803400,3804799,They burn the flag.
1319,3804840,3806193,"They demonstrate
against us"
1320,3806280,3808589,"on the cover
of the paper today."
1321,3808680,3810033,They have no respect.
1322,3810120,3811473,They have no idea
1323,3811560,3813357,"what's going on
over there"
1324,3813440,3815590,"and the men that are
sacrificing their lives."
1325,3815680,3817033,"Nobody here
seems to care."
1326,3817120,3819793,"It's a bunch
of goddamned shit."
1327,3819880,3823509,"Don't take the Lord's name in vain
in front of the children."
1328,3823560,3825710,"I agree with
everything you say."
1329,3825800,3827153,I served my country.
1330,3827240,3829549,"They just want
to take from it."
1331,3829640,3831471,Love it or leave it.
1332,3831560,3832879,The other side's angry
1333,3832960,3834313,"because
we're not winning."
1334,3834400,3835799,How can we win?
1335,3835880,3837233,"Tommy,
what's the matter?"
1336,3837320,3838150,Nothing.
1337,3838240,3839593,"Anybody listening here?
Tommy?"
1338,3839680,3840556,What?
1339,3840640,3842437,"Tommy's going
to fail English."
1340,3842480,3844869,"He doesn't believe
in the war."
1341,3845840,3847831,What?
1342,3847880,3850599,"He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing"
1343,3850640,3851550,over there.
1344,3851600,3854433,"He thinks
it's all a mistake."
1345,3854480,3857313,"Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out."
1346,3857360,3858759,"You believe
in demonstrators?"
1347,3858800,3859869,Huh? What?
1348,3859920,3862753,"I just don't agree
with everything you're saying."
1349,3862800,3864677,"I don't think
you understand."
1350,3864720,3866597,"What does
Tommy know?"
1351,3866640,3868232,I don't understand?
1352,3868320,3870151,"He's hanging around
with longhairs"
1353,3870240,3871832,who take drugs!
1354,3871880,3873279,That's not the reason.
1355,3873320,3874435,Have they ever worked?
1356,3874520,3876670,"You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?"
1357,3876760,3877875,What is this?
1358,3877960,3880349,"You want to
bring down this country?"
1359,3880440,3882715,"Love it
or leave it, Tommy."
1360,3882760,3884591,"All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,"
1361,3884680,3887035,"is they don't
want more people"
1362,3887080,3888832,to come back like you.
1363,3888880,3890199,That's an easy excuse.
1364,3890280,3893397,"Where were they when
their country needed them?"
1365,3893480,3894833,You served your country.
1366,3894920,3897718,"What did you
get out of it?"
1367,3897800,3899518,Look at you.
1368,3899560,3902393,"Well, look at me."
1369,3902440,3904192,"Look at you, man."
1370,3904240,3907232,"I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?"
1371,3907280,3909157,"What's wrong
with me, Tommy?"
1372,3909240,3910912,"What's wrong
with me?"
1373,3911000,3912956,"Is there something
wrong with me?"
1374,3913000,3914353,"I volunteered,
Tommy!"
1375,3914440,3917159,"You don't know
what you're talking about!"
1376,3917200,3918599,Were you there?
1377,3918640,3921950,"You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!"
1378,3922040,3923393,"Mom, I can't believe"
1379,3923440,3925635,"what Tommy just
said to me."
1380,3925680,3926715,I can't...
1381,3926760,3930275,"I can't believe
what Tommy just said to me."
1382,3936000,3937228,"Parade time, Ronnie."
1383,3937320,3940756,"You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?"
1384,3942120,3945112,What kind of car is it?
1385,3945160,3946718,"I think it's
a Continental."
1386,3946760,3947829,Continental?
1387,3947880,3948915,A convertible?
1388,3949000,3949876,Yeah.
1389,3949960,3951632,"They said
it would be."
1390,3951720,3953312,"Coming up
in the world."
1391,3957480,3959675,Would you like to ride
1392,3959720,3963156,In my beautiful balloon
1393,3963240,3965356,Would you like to ride
1394,3965440,3968477,In my beautiful balloon
1395,3968520,3971717,"We could float among
the stars together"
1396,3971760,3973796,You and I
1397,3973880,3976997,For we can fly
1398,3977040,3980350,We can fly
1399,3980440,3982635,"Up, up and away"
1400,3982720,3984472,In my beautiful
1401,3984520,3985714,My beautiful
1402,3985800,3991670,Balloon
1403,4011520,4012839,Die!
1404,4058240,4062153,"Today is July the 4th,
and I believe in America."
1405,4063640,4065631,"And I believe
in Americanism."
1406,4066880,4068233,"But most of all,"
1407,4068320,4070754,"I believe in victory
for America."
1408,4072480,4075552,"Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,"
1409,4075640,4077312,that we shouldn't be there.
1410,4077400,4080233,"Some people would like to
tear our country down."
1411,4080320,4081799,But who are the kids
1412,4081880,4083711,"defending their right
to protest?"
1413,4083800,4085950,"These are the kids
who care about America,"
1414,4086040,4088679,"kids who have respect
for their flag"
1415,4088760,4090910,"and their parents
and their government"
1416,4091000,4093309,and their religion.
1417,4093400,4095709,Kids like Joey Walsh.
