- No, she's not dead. She's gone."
78,445385,448762,"- You love her still?
- Jesus, man!"
79,452934,456395,You're over her? Rubbish.

- I work in a hoover repair shop."
85,473538,477418,"- A hoover?
- You know, like a vacuum cleaner."
86,477503,480838,"- You fix vacuum cleaners?
- I do."
87,480923,483841,I have a broken vacuum cleaner!

I don't have my tools with me."
121,622155,625115,"I'm going on me break.
Can you bring it in tomorrow?"
122,625200,629538,"Er, no. I bring it today. You..."

you have a look at it, at least?"

- I come with you, then?"
126,642386,644720,"- For lunch?
- Yeah. Alright."
127,644805,646806,"- Yes? We go together?
- Yeah."

131,661571,666158,"So... you know
a bit about music then?"
132,667911,672248,"My father used to play
in the orchestra back at home."
133,672332,674166,He played violin.
134,675210,679130,"But he got arthritis then
and he killed himself."
135,679214,681134,Really?
136,681218,684011,"But before he go,
he teach me how to play piano."
137,684096,686389,"It's not so hard on the fingers,
he said."
138,687224,692437,"- Do you get to play much?
- No, I don't have a piano at home."
139,692521,694188,I can't get one in Ireland.

I can't afford it."
141,697609,699485,"Yeah, it's expensive alright."
142,709039,714544,"I play the piano, so this man lets me
play one hour per day at lunch."
143,714628,718298,"- Somewhere around here?
- Do you want to hear me play?"

- OK for me to play today?"
151,743117,745327,"- Yeah, that's fine.
- Thanks."
152,745411,748538,"- Not the baby Yamaha, she's sold.
- Okey-dokey."

156,832627,835298,"- That kind of thing.
- (exhales)"
157,836466,840011,It's amazing. Did you write that?
158,840095,842763,"No, no. Mendelssohn did."
159,842848,846100,"- It's good.
- (laughs) It's good, yes."
160,846268,848811,"- Play me another of your songs.
- No."
161,848896,850897,"- Please.
- Not here."
162,851064,853774,Why? Bill doesn't mind.
163,853859,856777,"- Do you think it would be alright?
- Yes."
164,858113,861616,"- OK. I'll put that there, yeah?
- Uh-huh."
165,864411,867997,"- This is in C, yeah?
- Yeah, I can see that."
166,868123,870166,(laughs) OK.
167,870250,872251,So it goes...
168,872336,876923,It goes... (hums tune)

175,933192,935068,That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.
176,935152,937155,"- So do you wanna give it a spin?
- Yes."
177,937240,939574,OK. (clears throat)

776,4125778,4130698,"Are you alright?
Did you write that for your husband?"
777,4130783,4134243,"- Yes, I did. And he didn't like it.
- (laughs)"
778,4134328,4137330,"- He's an idiot.
- Yeah, he's an idiot."

781,4163982,4166526,"Come on, away to London with me."
782,4166610,4169737,"We'll write loads of songs
and live in a nice flat."
783,4169822,4172990,"You can bring Ivonka over.
It'll be brilliant. Come on."
784,4173075,4176746,"Yeah, we'll go to London
and no one will ever find us again."
785,4176831,4179124,No one. We'll have a brilliant band.
786,4179208,4181459,We'll sell out places. It'll be great.
787,4181544,4184671,"- And we'll make an album together.
- I'd love that. Come on."
788,4184755,4187173,Yeah. I'll do the backing vocals on it.
789,4187258,4189676,"- Yeah. And play the piano.
- (laughs)"
790,4189760,4193179,"- Come on. I'm serious.

798,4231473,4234516,I think it's time we did the car test.
799,4234601,4236768,"What's the car test, Eamon?"
800,4236853,4240272,"We've been listening back
on these big studio speakers,"
801,4240356,4244359,"so I think it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers."
802,4244444,4247654,"Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car."
803,4247739,4250115,"- Great, man.
- Alright?"
804,4250200,4252284,"- Yeah.
- Let's go."
