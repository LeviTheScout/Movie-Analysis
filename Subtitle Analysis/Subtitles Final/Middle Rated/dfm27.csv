or girlfriend..."

ever masturbate?"
1282,4340879,4342630,Um... (chuckles)
1283,4342714,4344340,"- Probably.
- He did."
1284,4344466,4346009,Did you?
1285,4346134,4347594,Maybe.
1286,4347677,4351806,"And did this simple act change
the love you had for him?"
1287,4351931,4352766,No.
1288,4352891,4354142,It didn't. Why is that?
1289,4354267,4355810,"I don't know.
Because it's meaningless."
1290,4355894,4358271,Exactly. And tell me this...

your vibrator and a human penis?"

1299,4377749,4379626,"but I've had plenty of sex
that was just as meaningless,"
1300,4379709,4381336,"if not more meaningless
than masturbation."
1301,4381419,4383838,"The only difference is
it's just more fun"
1302,4383963,4386966,"having sex with a person
