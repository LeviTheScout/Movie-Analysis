- Look, Daddy, a volcano."
2,55139,57516,That's very pretty. Drink up your volcano.
3,57642,61854,"- All right, we're going. Mummy's waiting.
- Daddy, please. Just one more minute?"
4,61979,62855,No.
5,62980,64357,"- We're going.
- No."
6,64482,65691,"- Yes.
- No."
7,65816,66943,Yes.
8,67068,68569,No.
9,70154,73532,Until I ended up flatlining at the hospital.
10,74283,78913,"But I survived and, instead of
letting that scare me, I kept on going."
11,80623,84460,Until my first daughter was born.
12,85920,90132,"And now, I look at my girls"
13,90257,93344,"and my husband,"
14,93469,97890,who has been standing by me for so long
15,101894,103813,Think which one you're gonna pull out.
16,103938,106148,"- I always think, man.
- No, you don't."
17,106274,108985,"They didn't lock you up this time
because you're not 18 yet."
18,109110,112321,"Next time, they're going to lock you up,
brother."
19,112446,114198,Come on.
20,123541,125459,You're not thinking.
21,125584,129297,"Stealing might get you money,
get to tap some cheerleader's ass,"
22,129422,131966,"show off riding some pickle-coloured
Thunderbird."
23,133926,136220,"But tell me, what's gonna happen
if you shoot a pregnant woman"
24,136345,138180,"or an old man, huh?"
25,141350,143352,You know what will happen?
26,144145,146772,The guilt will suck you down to the bone.
27,159160,160828,Stealing ain't worth it.
28,160953,165541,"Going to church, reading the Bible
and believing in Jesus, brother -"
29,165666,167752,that's your ticket.
30,171172,172965,Yeah.
31,174175,176177,"Think it's a fantasy, right?"
32,181515,184351,"Come here, man. Get up, come here."
33,191317,193861,"See that truck? Beauty, ain't it?"
34,193986,196030,"- I won it at a friend's raffle.
- No shit."
35,196155,199784,No shit. You know what? It wasn't luck.
36,199909,201911,"It was Jesus who wanted me
to have that truck."
37,202036,204288,That's bullshit. I bet you stole it.
38,206248,208667,Jesus gave me that truck.
39,210211,213672,"And it's He who gives
and He who takes away."
40,213798,216008,"Yeah, right. He doesn't give a shit about us."
41,216133,217134,Come back.
42,217760,219637,Come back!
43,224266,226268,Take off the hat.
44,226769,228771,Take off that hat.
45,231774,234902,"God even knows
when a single hair moves on your head."
46,238155,240157,"You're wrong, Nick."
47,266600,270146,"So, this is death's waiting room."
48,271522,274400,These ridiculous tubes.
49,276443,279321,These needles swelling my arms.
50,285077,287788,What am I doing in this pre-corpse club?
51,289623,291709,What do I have to do with them?
52,296338,299133,"I don't know when anything began
any more."
53,300092,302178,Or when it's gonna end.
54,305055,307975,Who will be the first to lose his life?
55,310478,313314,"He, in the coma?"
56,319361,321363,Or me?
57,364073,367826,All right. You can get dressed now.
58,367952,371121,Your fallopian tubes are severely damaged.
59,371247,374750,"It, uh, looks like you had
some kind of infection"
60,374875,378587,that wasn't taken care of properly.
61,378712,383550,"We can try surgery but I have to tell you,
I think the probabilities are pretty slim."
62,385344,387429,Look
63,387554,391558,"excuse me for asking this,
but it's important that you tell me the truth."
64,392560,394728,Have you ever had an abortion?
65,401485,404363,"- Yes.
- Any reason?"
66,406240,410160,"I had already separated from my husband
when I got pregnant"
67,410286,413080,"No, I meant medical reason."
68,416500,419753,"- My husband's dying.
- I'm sorry?"
69,419878,422089,"Paul, my husband, he's dying."
70,422214,424216,And I want to have his baby.
71,425718,430806,"We can operate, then, and hope you get
pregnant within three or four months."
72,433475,436145,"He's got one month left, at most."
73,442026,444570,"- How did it go?
- Not good, Reverend."
74,444695,448032,"- In one ear, out the other.
- Be patient."
75,448157,450701,"All it takes is one sheep in a thousand, Jack.
Come on."
76,450826,454330,"Afternoon, Reverend. Hey, Wolf, you still
having that birthday party Wednesday?"
77,454455,456290,"- My place, brother.
- Cool."
78,458000,460377,"I may be late, Jack.
I have Bible class Wednesday."
79,460502,462880,"- Let it go.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?"
80,463005,465341,"Here, hold this."
81,465466,467343,"- I will hurt you, boy!
- Paul."
82,467468,470137,"- All motherfucking day!
- Back off. Back."
83,470262,472931,"- I told you to think.
- Fuck you."
84,474558,475851,Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
85,475976,479521,"- Hit me. Hit me, huh?
- Jack! Jack! Jack! Hey! Hey!"
86,479647,481690,"Come on, come on."
87,481982,483984,"Leave it, Jack."
88,485152,486987,"He's a kid, Jack."
89,487112,489490,"- He's a punk, Reverend.
- No, he's a kid."
90,491158,493744,"You think, Jack. You think."
91,502836,506215,"For those who are
making decisions that affect our life"
92,506340,509802,"we must call out to God
to give them His wisdom"
93,509927,511887,Daddy's home. I'll see you tomorrow.
94,512012,514765,"I'll pick the boys up after school
if you want me to."
95,515766,518143,Daddy!
96,518268,520396,"- Hello.
- Hey, baby."
97,521480,523315,How's my queen?
98,523857,525984,"- And Hercules?
- You don't have a queen."
99,526110,529613,"Freddy, help me out.
I got the cooler from the religious centre."
100,529738,533283,"- Dad, are we gonna go buy a dog now?
- Freddy, we agreed, no dogs."
101,533409,536453,"- Why not? You said if I got good grades
- We've been through this a thousand times,"
102,536578,539581,"your sister has allergies
and dog hair is bad for her."
103,539706,542084,"It's bad for her, not me. Get me a dog."
104,542209,546213,"- Freddy, leave it alone.
- Well, at least get me a hamster."
105,546922,551677,"- We'll see.
- We'll see? You always say you promise."
106,578454,581665,"Hey, Wolf! Are you back,
motherfucker?"
107,581790,583917,Lock down six!
108,586044,588046,Six down!
109,606940,609401,"- I win.
- Age before beauty."
110,610819,612613,Such a sore loser.
111,619661,621246,"Do you want to go to the Jacuzzi
for a while?"
112,621371,623123,"Shit. No, I can't."
113,623248,625834,"Michael and the girls
are waiting for me already."
114,625959,627002,OK.
115,627127,629671,"- Well, call me later.
- I'll call you."
116,632466,633967,Cristina?
117,636803,641391,"If you get away from leading your family
like a man of God ought to lead his family -"
118,641517,644895,in prayer and reading the word of God
119,645020,648857,"and the things of God
and bringing them to the house of God -"
120,648982,652736,"then you're opening a door for the devil
to come in and slay your family."
121,652861,654071,Amen.
122,654196,656698,"- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light."
123,656824,659493,"- Jesus is our hope.
- Jesus is our hope."
124,659618,663121,"- Jesus is our forgiveness.
- Jesus is our forgiveness."
125,663247,666375,Jesus is the water that quenches my thirst.
126,666500,668919,"Jesus is the water
that quenches my thirst."
127,669044,673423,"- If you're saved and you know it, say amen.
- Amen!"
128,673549,675551,Everybody up on your feet!
129,677177,680430,"- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light."
130,781948,785118,"Hey, honey, I'm home."
131,806723,809101,"- Hi.
- Jesus, you scared me."
132,809226,810977,How are you feeling?
133,811103,814147,"- I feel great.
- Have you been smoking again?"
134,815482,817651,"For fuck's sake, Paul."
135,818485,821655,"If they find out you're smoking
they'll take you off the transplant list."
136,821780,824032,If I don't smoke I go fucking nuts.
137,824157,826159,Better nuts than dead.
138,827202,829246,Not necessarily.
139,829371,831456,I don't know how the hell you get them.
140,836712,838338,"Baby, baby"
141,838463,841717,"Baby, baby."
142,841842,847055,"Oh, God! Call an ambulance."
143,849474,851560,Call a fucking ambulance!
144,852602,854438,God damn it.
145,855439,857858,Please do something.
146,868660,870203,Come on. Please.
147,906656,908909,"- Whoops.
- Can you handle your clubs?"
148,909034,912746,"Jack, the boss wants to talk to you.
Wants to see you now."
149,913455,916958,"Come on, we both know I'm not a caddy yet."
150,917084,921171,"But I'm working at it.
And I'm learning, Brown."
151,923423,925801,"Man, I swear to God,
I'm not going to let you down."
152,925926,927844,"No, Jack, that's not the problem."
153,928762,930055,What's the problem?
154,930180,933266,"The problem is, some members have
started complaining about your tattoos."
155,933391,935310,"- I got a long-sleeved shirt.
- No, man."
156,935435,938772,"No long-sleeved shirt gonna cover
that one on your neck right there."
157,938897,941108,Or are you gonna start wearing a scarf?
158,945278,947906,"Look, Jack, this club is for people
different from me and you"
159,948031,951159,"No, no, no.
You know, I don't drink, I don't steal."
160,951284,953829,"I'm clean. Tell me, why me?"
161,953954,955747,"Look, I know you're clean,
that's why I hired you."
162,955872,958917,"But this decision comes
from the administration"
163,959042,962921,"and if I don't follow through with it,
they're gonna fuck me too."
164,967175,969511,"Look, I cut you a hefty severance cheque,"
165,969636,971763,"you can pick it up on the way
to the cashier's."
166,972889,974641,Try to understand.
167,1011511,1015432,"OK, good. So, is there any pain?"
168,1015557,1017309,My head hurts a little bit.
169,1017434,1019728,"That's normal. That's because
of the blood-pressure medicine."
170,1019853,1022147,"We'll get you something else
to make you feel better."
171,1022272,1023690,Thank you.
172,1023815,1027027,I brought what you asked for.
173,1027152,1029195,"Oh, my God."
174,1033408,1035410,Is that my heart?
175,1042292,1044044,The culprit.
176,1060936,1063188,Which one is he?
177,1065440,1067609,That's him with the brown vest.
178,1067734,1070236,He's putting the bag up on the top right now.
179,1084000,1085627,You OK?
180,1096054,1097514,Come here.
181,1102602,1104437,I want to kill him.
182,1105438,1107440,We have to kill him.
183,1112654,1116574,"Thank you, Lord, for keeping us together,
for filling us with love"
184,1116700,1118827,and for giving us this meal. Amen.
185,1118952,1120745,"- Amen.
- Amen."
186,1128336,1130338,I got fired from the club today.
187,1135301,1139389,"- 'Cause of your good pal Brown, right?
- He had nothing to do with it."
188,1139514,1142559,"- You believe that, Jack?
- Yes, I do."
189,1143810,1146396,"- Freddy, stop it.
- Mommy, Freddy hit me in the arm."
190,1146521,1149149,"- Which arm, baby?
- This one."
191,1149274,1152360,"Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you."
192,1155405,1157365,"- Give me that.
- Jack, no!"
193,1157490,1159034,Hold it out.
194,1159159,1163872,"«Whoever slaps you on the right cheek,
turn the other to him also. »"
195,1166750,1169002,"- Hit her. Don't be afraid.
- Jack!"
196,1169127,1171087,Hit her!
197,1174424,1177677,"Isn't that great? Wonderful.
Great parenting, Jack."
198,1177802,1179846,Good job. It's OK.
199,1179971,1181973,He didn't hurt her.
200,1197238,1199491,There's no hitting in this house.
201,1199616,1202535,You understand? Get in the corner.
202,1213421,1215924,"Do I put the chocolate chips
in now, Mommy?"
203,1216049,1218385,"That's right, honey, and then stir."
204,1220637,1222347,Stir real quick.
205,1222472,1225058,"Laura, put that back. Come on."
206,1225600,1229062,"- When's Daddy coming?
- Soon. Now let's get this finished, honey."
207,1233900,1237362,"No, Laura, stop it now."
208,1238905,1241157,Next Friday? Ask Lupe to stay the night.
209,1241282,1244452,"I can't stay 'cause I invited
the company managers over for dinner."
210,1244577,1246788,I fired her.
211,1246913,1249207,You fired her? Why?
212,1250959,1253253,She made me feel like a cripple.
213,1253378,1255630,"God damn it, Paul."
214,1256464,1258508,So now who's going to cook for you?
215,1258633,1262262,"Who's going to clean up after you,
who's going to take care of you? Who?"
216,1262387,1265723,"- I can do it for myself.
- Oh, you can do it by yourself?"
217,1267684,1269894,"I can't do it any more, Paul."
218,1270019,1272147,"Really, I can't."
219,1290123,1295128,"- What are you doing?
- I'm just What does it feel like I'm doing?"
220,1295962,1298756,"- Don't. You might hurt yourself.
- I'm not gonna hurt myself."
221,1298882,1300884,"Besides, I need you to"
222,1303094,1306890,"- I went to a fertility clinic.
- Oh, good, more doctors."
223,1307015,1309642,"Mary, I can't have this discussion again."
224,1309767,1312187,"No, this is a this is a specialist."
225,1312312,1316107,"He said that with surgery I might get
pregnant. You need to donate sperm"
226,1316232,1319110,"- No.
- I could take care of him."
227,1319235,1322280,But I can't. So what's the point?
228,1324616,1326951,This is what I most want in the world.
229,1327452,1329829,"Do it for me, please."
230,1385843,1388346,This will be 58.95.
231,1397397,1398815,Thank you.
232,1407156,1409867,"Did you find everything you need, sir?"
233,1409993,1412704,I'll have
234,1412829,1415415,"Oh, you know what? I left my wallet."
235,1439647,1441983,"- It's gonna be hot.
- Great."
236,1443443,1447989,"- When does my brother plan to show up?
- He said he'd be back by six."
237,1453453,1456289,100% pure golden lager.
238,1456998,1459125,Are you out of your mind?
239,1460335,1461586,"Oh, it's warm."
240,1461711,1463212,"Hey, if you want to drink lemonade
all night"
241,1463338,1465340,"- No, no, no.
- No, just give"
242,1471638,1473765,Katie? Laura?
243,1475683,1477685,Where are you guys?

245,1496079,1497372,"Hi, sweetheart, it's Dad."
246,1497497,1500541,"I was hoping we could have lunch
one day next week. Give me a call."
247,1501376,1503503,"Hi, honey, I'm on my way home."
248,1503628,1505797,"If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me"
249,1505922,1510218,"Girls, no. Don't touch. Laura, stop it."
250,1510343,1513638,"Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye."

252,1530363,1531864,Hello.
253,1534033,1535535,Speaking.
254,1546087,1547588,What?
255,1553052,1554887,Where?
256,1602143,1605146,Stay here. I'll be right back.
257,1612487,1616365,"Mary, you understand that even
if the operation is successful"
258,1616491,1619118,artificial insemination doesn't always work.
259,1619243,1621287,It doesn't matter. We want to try.
260,1623664,1625166,Paul?
261,1626876,1628211,Yeah.
262,1633007,1635051,"Now, Paul, um"
263,1636093,1638930,"This is about having a child,"
264,1639055,1642225,"and, with your condition,"
265,1642350,1644852,"you know you probably
won't ever meet him."
266,1647438,1649816,"Well, life goes on, right?"
267,1650817,1651901,All right.
268,1652026,1657198,"I'd like you to put on one of these gloves
to avoid contaminating the sample."
269,1657323,1660827,"And, uh, try to make it
all land in the receptacle."
270,1662286,1664664,"When you're done, just leave it in here."
271,1667542,1670378,In case you need a little inspiration.
272,1678177,1680596,"Hey, big boy, how are you doing?"
273,1680721,1685560,"- Oh, yeah, are you ready to party?
- Yeah, well, I'm here now."
274,1688688,1691732,"Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
275,1691858,1693859,"Oh! Oh, God!"
276,1694860,1697738,Mm! I'm gonna come really quick!
277,1714005,1718050,"Dr Swann, call the operator."
278,1718175,1719468,"Excuse me,"
279,1719594,1722471,"my husband and daughters were in
an accident and I was told to come here."
280,1722597,1725558,"- What were their names?
- Michael, Katherine and Laura Peck."
281,1725683,1727476,OK.
282,1731397,1733399,Excuse me for a minute.
283,1735776,1738279,"- Cris?
- What happened, sweetheart?"
284,1738404,1741032,"I don't know,
they haven't told me anything yet."
285,1741157,1744535,"- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, everything will be OK, don't worry."
286,1750291,1753794,"What is the most important question
for safe sex?"
287,1753919,1755504,What?
288,1755630,1757632,What time does your husband get home?
289,1759508,1761510,"That's good, huh?"
290,1767850,1769852,His Highness has arrived.
291,1775274,1777401,Let's see what he comes up with.
292,1780947,1782990,Serve up that chilli.
293,1783115,1785117,"- Ah-ah-ah-ah.
- Oh, shit."
294,1789163,1792792,"It's seven o'clock. What are you gonna
make up this time - traffic?"
295,1792917,1797046,"You were preaching the word? The entire
congregation's been waiting for you."
296,1797171,1799465,"It's your party, remember?"
297,1800299,1802176,What's wrong?
298,1805179,1806889,Have you been drinking?
299,1808724,1810309,"You didn't drink again, did you?"
300,1813020,1815481,I just ran over a man and two girls.
301,1819652,1821696,"You're lying, right?"
302,1829495,1831622,I was driving home
303,1832998,1835000,took a turn
304,1837044,1838629,"a little too quickly,"
305,1838754,1840715,didn't see them crossing.
306,1869785,1872371,Can't you go any faster?
307,1876083,1878586,"Oh, God. Baby"
308,1887636,1889638,I love you.
309,1896437,1898439,Deep breath.
310,1901192,1903694,Good. Your lungs are clear.
311,1903819,1905654,"- I got a question for you.
- Yeah."
312,1905780,1907490,Whose heart do I have?
313,1907615,1911952,"Uh, I can't tell you, it's hospital regulations."
314,1912078,1914830,"Just like the donor's family
doesn't know your name either."
315,1914955,1916624,But you know?
316,1916749,1918417,Yes.
317,1919251,1921170,"This is your heart now,"
318,1921295,1923714,"- that's all that should matter to you.
- I want to know who saved my life."
319,1923839,1926175,"If you want, you can write
an anonymous letter to the family"
320,1926300,1927676,through the Donors' Association.
321,1927802,1930596,"Personally, I think it's better that
you don't know."
322,1946320,1950157,"- Mrs Peck? Dr Jones.
- What happened to my family?"
323,1950282,1953285,"- Please sit down.
- No, I'm OK."
324,1953410,1954411,What happened?
325,1954537,1957039,"Your husband and your daughters
were hit by a car."
326,1957164,1960501,"We had to perform emergency surgery
on your husband."
327,1960626,1963170,"Your husband suffered
multiple skull fractures"
328,1963295,1966549,"and we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain."
329,1966674,1967967,He's in critical condition
330,1968092,1970928,"and we're concerned that
he's showing low brain activity."
331,1973597,1976600,Is he gonna be all right?
332,1976725,1979019,We're doing the best we can.
333,1979144,1981146,And what about my daughters?
334,1987528,1991532,"Your youngest daughter was brought in
with severe bleeding."
335,1991657,1994285,She just wasn't able to get here in time.
336,1995286,1997079,I'm very sorry. They
337,1997997,2000082,They both died in the accident.
338,2001208,2003669,No.
339,2005004,2008424,"No Oh, my God."
340,2011552,2013554,"Oh, my God!"
341,2015556,2017558,"No! Oh, my God!"
342,2024356,2026358,Where are they?!
343,2028402,2030404,Where Where are they?
344,2031697,2035743,"Mrs Peck, your girls are here
and you can see them if you like. But"
345,2035868,2036952,I wanna see them.
346,2037077,2040247,"Mrs Peck,
I wouldn't recommend it."
347,2040372,2043000,"Oh, God, Daddy.
Oh, Daddy."
348,2043125,2047796,"I'm very sorry. If you'll excuse us,
we have to get back to Mr Peck."
349,2049715,2051800,I'm very sorry.
350,2056722,2059224,"Oh, God"
351,2060643,2062353,"Oh, God."
352,2063520,2068233,"- We want dinner!
- Marianne, we'd like some dinner in here."
353,2070611,2072571,"Tell Reverend John to stay,"
354,2072696,2075115,"make sure no one notices
and get everyone to leave."
355,2075240,2078494,"- What happened?
- Trish, just do what I tell you."
356,2080496,2082122,It's going to be OK.
357,2083082,2084875,It's all gonna be OK.
358,2086418,2089296,Come on. Start the truck up.
359,2089421,2091257,"Start the truck up, pull it in."
360,2091382,2092549,"Come on, baby."
361,2130379,2132172,"Hey, Jack!"
362,2133966,2135968,"What are you doing here, man?"
363,2137261,2139305,"Just came to pick up my things, Brown."
364,2150232,2152067,"Why don't you let me
buy you a couple of beers?"
365,2152192,2153861,"I don't drink, Brown."
366,2153986,2155863,How about a Diet Coke?
367,2156822,2160075,"I've been talking to a buddy of mine
about hooking you up with a job,"
368,2160200,2162202,I've been telling him all about you.
369,2164955,2168208,"So what do you say, huh? I've been
feeling shitty about what went down."
370,2168333,2170836,"- Come on.
- I understand."
371,2171337,2172963,So what do you say?
372,2173088,2177593,"As you know, the doctors did everything
they could to save your husband's life,"
373,2177718,2180512,but he has shown no brain activity.
374,2181346,2186310,"We're here to help you with some of
the final decisions that need to be made."
375,2187436,2190355,We have a patient who is gravely ill.
376,2191356,2195402,"I'm here to give you some information
on organ donation."
377,2196487,2199239,"Are you willing for your husband
to donate his heart?"
378,2199364,2201992,"- Can we discuss this another time?
- I'm afraid not."
379,2202117,2206163,"I can give you time to discuss it, but this is
a decision that needs to be made soon."
380,2206288,2208290,Paul?
381,2209666,2211710,"Paul, the beeper."
382,2220511,2223472,It's the hospital. I think they've got a heart.
383,2230020,2234108,"Hello?
Yes, I'm calling on behalf of Mr Paul Rivers."
384,2235317,2236610,Yes.
385,2238237,2240072,"OK. Yes, I understand."
386,2241240,2243033,Where do I have to take him?
387,2272563,2274273,"Good luck, my love."
388,2343217,2344551,Hello.
389,2347221,2348555,Hello.
390,2351225,2354228,"- Does your shoulder bother you?
- Why?"
391,2354353,2357898,"Because I was watching you swim before
and you have a wide stroke."
392,2358023,2361026,If you bring it in tighter you get a better glide.
393,2364029,2366031,Thanks for the advice.
394,2372329,2375832,"- Do you mind if I join you?
- Actually, I was just leaving."
395,2376875,2378669,There you go.
396,2381797,2384091,Maybe just until you finish?
397,2384216,2386176,"No, maybe next time."
398,2395435,2399231,"Did you know that eating alone
can cause kidney damage? And that's bad."
399,2405821,2407698,All right. Sorry.
400,2437102,2439688,"-
- Hello?"
401,2440564,2442357,Hello. Is Ana there?
402,2442482,2444526,What?
403,2444651,2447529,"- Is Ana there?
- Hang on a sec. Ana?"
404,2448447,2449698,Ana!
405,2449823,2451491,Phone call.
406,2452617,2454453,Hello.
407,2456747,2458540,Hello?
408,2461335,2462753,Who is it?
409,2473472,2475182,"Hi, honey, I'm on my way home."
410,2475307,2477517,"If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me know."
411,2477643,2481104,"Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it."
412,2481938,2485609,"Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye."
413,2513970,2515555,Did you go?
414,2521561,2523146,Are they dead?
415,2530946,2533240,I'm gonna turn myself in.
416,2533365,2536284,"John says nobody saw you, nobody."
417,2536410,2538495,"They don't know the license plate
or what kind of car."
418,2538620,2540539,"- Some asshole even swears it was a Cat.
- Marianne, what would you do"
419,2540664,2543250,if these were our children? Tell me.
420,2543375,2546211,They're not. It didn't happen to us.
421,2549423,2551758,"No, it didn't happen to us."
422,2553135,2555387,It happened to me.
423,2569735,2573029,"What the fuck do you gain
by turning yourself in?"
424,2573155,2578410,"- It's my duty, Marianne.
- No, Jack, your duty is here with us,"
425,2578535,2580745,your family.
426,2582914,2585792,"- My duty is to God.
- Please."
427,2585917,2587794,"Marianne,"
428,2588753,2590422,get out of my way.
429,2592340,2594134,Jack.
430,2649439,2652150,"Oh, buddy! Right there."
431,2652984,2654778,My turn.
432,2656071,2658406,I think I better go back to the hospital.
433,2662536,2663703,He deserves it.
434,2663829,2665914,"I thought your doctor said
you're not supposed to eat that."
435,2666039,2670043,"- I'm making up for lost time.
- Lost time not lost pounds."
436,2670168,2672379,"We're gonna have to send you back
for liposuction."
437,2672504,2677884,"Well, here's to all those
who didn't think I was gonna die."
438,2678009,2680095,"Hear, hear!"
439,2680220,2682055,And to the first day of my new life.
440,2682180,2683181,"- Congratulations.
- Cheers."
441,2683306,2686309,"It's good to have you home.
Knew you'd make it."
442,2686434,2688353,It's so wonderful.
443,2688478,2690438,I also have an announcement to make.
444,2690564,2695569,"I wanted to tell you that Paul and I
are going to be parents."
445,2695694,2697070,That's great!
446,2697195,2699573,"There's a scary thought,
Paul being a parent."
447,2699698,2701992,"- You kept this real quiet.
- Have you told your parents yet?"
448,2702117,2705912,"No. Well, we're going to be parents,
we just don't know when yet."
449,2706037,2707664,I'm going to have an operation
450,2707789,2711209,"and then we're going to try
artificial insemination."
451,2711334,2714588,"Terrific.
Artificial insemination, huh?"
452,2714713,2718258,"Professor, do your female students know
you no longer have lead in your pencil?"
453,2722262,2724264,Play nice.
454,2725390,2730061,"Come on, let's pass the cake around.
Cut me a piece about half that size."
455,2730186,2731980,I can't wait to hear all the details.
456,2748496,2750457,"- Mr Donneaud?
- Mr Rivers?"
457,2750582,2751750,Yeah.
458,2751875,2753460,Thanks for coming.
459,2753585,2755295,"Sorry I couldn't cancel this appointment,"
460,2755420,2757631,"but the way I'm bowling today
I probably should have."
461,2757756,2760550,"- Have a seat here. Park it right there.
- All right."
462,2800799,2803718,"- Can I bring you something to eat?
- I'm not hungry."
463,2803843,2806971,"- Honey, you need to eat something.
- I'm fine, Dad."
464,2810975,2814646,"When your mother died
I thought I wasn't going to make it."
465,2815730,2820110,"I felt the world was falling on me
and that I was never going to get up."
466,2821111,2824989,"But, sweetie, life goes on."
467,2829285,2831371,You know what I thought when Mom died?
468,2834499,2839212,"I couldn't understand how
you could talk to people again."
469,2841089,2843591,How you could laugh
470,2843717,2845719,again.
471,2846970,2849764,"I couldn't understand
how you could play with us."
472,2852726,2856020,"And no. No, that's a lie."
473,2858273,2860692,Life does not just go on.
474,2871870,2874539,"Louise is getting fat, don't you think?"
475,2874664,2877375,"She's done nothing but eat
since Robert left her."
476,2879085,2881254,"What, she looks OK to you?"
477,2882297,2885175,"Why did you tell everybody
we're having a baby?"
478,2886009,2888094,I wanted to share our plans with them.
479,2890847,2892432,That's what I mean. They're our plans.
480,2892557,2895310,"Why does everyone have to know
our private life?"
481,2895435,2897729,Why the fuss? They're our best friends.
482,2898730,2901316,But we haven't even talked about it.
483,2901441,2904444,"Oh, we haven't?
I thought this was more than settled."
484,2904569,2906237,"Things change, Mary."
485,2908406,2910742,It's something we have to think about.
486,2910867,2913036,I don't have anything to think about.
487,2913161,2915622,I've already made my decision.
488,2920293,2922212,Would you help me with the glasses?
489,2933890,2936100,"Do you want me
to stay with you tonight?"
490,2936226,2938228,"I'm OK, thanks."
491,2942440,2944901,I just want to be alone.
492,2955203,2957038,Cris
493,2959791,2961626,The police called.
494,2963211,2967173,"They said you need to go
and press charges."
495,2967298,2969300,I'll go with you if you want.
496,2970134,2972303,I'm not going to do anything.
497,2975598,2978977,This guy waswas some ex-con.
498,2979102,2981312,"Are you really going to let him
just walk the streets?"
499,2981437,2985024,"- What do you want me to do?
- He ran over Michael and your daughters"
500,2985149,2990154,"Nothing I can do is going to
bring them back. Do you get that?"
501,3001249,3003418,"Hey, how are you doing?"
502,3003543,3006129,"- You found it OK?
- Yeah, I did."
503,3007171,3010884,"The donor's name was Michael Peck.
He was 37 years old."
504,3011009,3013011,An architect and married.
505,3013136,3017599,"This is the authorization for transplant
signed by his wife, Cristina Williams Peck."
506,3017724,3021060,"I have a copy of the medical report
if you'd care to see it,"
507,3021185,3025732,"and I also have the widow's phone number
and address just in case you're interested."
508,3025857,3028026,How did Michael Peck die?
509,3030320,3032780,You might have seen it in the newspaper.
510,3033865,3037911,"This guy named Jack Jordan
ran over Mr Peck and his two little girls,"
511,3038036,3040580,"October 10th, 6:50pm."
512,3040705,3045418,"This Jack Jordan's a piece of work.
He's been in and out of jail since he was 16."
513,3045543,3050340,"Car thief, small-time crook,
drugs, bad cheques, alcoholism."
514,3052050,3055219,"Last time he was in jail's
only been two years ago."
515,3059432,3061643,"You feeling OK, Mr Rivers?"
516,3064062,3066105,"That's what you wanted, isn't it?"
517,3067315,3069525,"- I just
- You want some water?"
518,3072737,3075615,He was an architect.
519,3075740,3077742,What's the point in getting involved?
520,3080703,3083081,"Mary, I want to know who I am now."
521,3084582,3086918,I don't think that's the way to do it.
522,3088169,3090129,"What is, then?"
523,3093132,3095468,Look for it with me.
524,3096886,3099931,"Let's look ahead together, not behind."
525,3113278,3115947,"Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday.
You didn't have one drink with me."
526,3116072,3118116,"Why don't you come over
to my place? I'm having a party."
527,3118241,3119993,"Yeah, I bet they're all
as boring as you are."
528,3120118,3123121,"- You'd be surprised.
- Nah, man, I'll pass."
529,3123246,3125873,"- Listen, I'll call you later about that job, OK?
- All right."
530,3127041,3128543,Thank you.
531,3132463,3134590,"Hey, Brown, you should."
532,3134716,3136718,I will.
533,3168958,3174339,"OK, now, we can schedule the surgery.
UmI could get you in as early as Monday."
534,3177091,3178509,Yeah.
535,3178634,3180261,9:00am?
536,3180386,3183056,"What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?"
537,3183181,3185058,"Well, I can't offer you a real number on that."
538,3185183,3189312,"Um, you know, there's the damage from
the abortion that wasn't handled properly,"
539,3189437,3191856,"- still blockage in
- What abortion?"
540,3193816,3195818,"What abortion, Mary?"
541,3196486,3198488,I can explain.
542,3198613,3201282,"- Explain what?
- There is an explanation."
543,3201407,3205703,"Uh-huh. All that drama
about artificial insemination,"
544,3205828,3210208,"kids' names, we got pictures
of our friends' babies all over the place."
545,3210666,3213920,"Why? So you can flush it
down the fucking toilet?"
546,3217173,3219634,"We've been a fraud for a long time, Mary."
547,3219759,3223971,"Oh, yeah? Why didn't you tell me that
when you were sick?"
548,3224097,3226599,"Or did you expect one of your girlfriends
to come and take care of you?"
549,3226724,3229727,"You came back because you wanted to,
don't blame me for that."
550,3230269,3232230,"I came back to take care of you
because I love you."
551,3232355,3234148,Or because you were feeling lonely.
552,3248871,3250748,I'm sorry.
553,3251791,3253709,I'm sorry.
554,3254585,3257213,We can't keep going like this.
555,3257338,3259549,"The insemination, the child."
556,3260758,3264595,"It's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid
on something that's just been bled dry."
557,3266430,3268266,It's finished.
558,3268850,3270435,Finished?
559,3270560,3274021,"It isn't finished if we give it a chance
and have this baby."
560,3275064,3278943,"- When we could have, you didn't want to.
- We were separated, God damn it!"
561,3279068,3281487,"- It's different now.
- Yes."
562,3281612,3284031,It's different.
563,3284157,3287869,"- Ready to go?
- You only know how to think about yourself."
564,3295543,3297545,Close six.
565,3302216,3304343,"Well, thanks for finally seeing me."
566,3307638,3309640,They tell me you don't want to eat.
567,3310641,3312643,I'm not hungry.
568,3314478,3316522,Jack
569,3316647,3319275,Jesus didn't come to free us from pain.
570,3319400,3322069,He came to give us the strength to bear it.
571,3323112,3326073,"- Maybe He wanted this pain for me.
- No, He had nothing to do with this."
572,3326199,3328951,"- It was an accident.
- No, it wasn't an accident."
573,3329076,3331078,Jesus chose me for this.
574,3333289,3334790,Jack
575,3335958,3338044,Ask for the mercy of Jesus Christ.
576,3339837,3344175,"If it was an accident,
why do I have to ask for His mercy?"
577,3344717,3347553,"«I will have mercy on whom
I will have mercy,"
578,3347678,3349764,"«I will have compassion
on whom I will have compassion. »"
579,3349889,3352642,"- Don't be so prideful, that's a sin.
- «But the fearful, and unbelieving,"
580,3352767,3355061,"- «and the abominable, the murderers»
- Jack, listen to me."
581,3355186,3358731,"«and whoremongers, and sorcerers,
and idolaters, and all liars"
582,3358856,3361234,"- Jesus came to save us not to damn us.
- «shall have their part in the lake»"
583,3361359,3364403,"«which burneth with fire and brimstone».
Revelation 21:8."
584,3364528,3368699,"Jesus loves you but He also knows
how to punish arrogant sinners like you."
585,3368824,3372411,"«As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten».
Revelation 3:19."
586,3372995,3374121,Jesus betrayed me.
587,3374247,3376832,"Stop this shit
or you're going straight to Hell."
588,3376958,3379126,Hell?
589,3379252,3381587,This is Hell. Right here.
590,3381712,3383422,You're damning your soul. You shut up now
591,3383548,3386425,"- and ask Christ for forgiveness.
- Hey! Forgive me?"
592,3386551,3389679,"I did everything He asked me to do.
I changed."
593,3389804,3393641,I gave Him my life and He betrayed me.
594,3393766,3396936,"He put that fucking truck in my hands
so I could carry out His will,"
595,3397061,3398813,"made me kill that man and those girls,"
596,3398938,3401524,"but hey, He didn't give me
the strength to stay and save them."
597,3401649,3405194,"Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this."
598,3407822,3410992,"God even knows when a single hair
moves on your head."
599,3413119,3415121,And you taught me that.
600,3417915,3420209,"We're gonna pray for you, Jack."
601,3433764,3434932,"Good evening, sir."
602,3490112,3492698,"Just like old times.
How the hell have you been?"
603,3493824,3497161,"Did you end up marrying that hunk
you brought around here last time?"
604,3497286,3499872,"- Yep.
- Yeah?"
605,3499997,3503626,"Is he a good lay?
How they make us suffer, huh?"
606,3503751,3506253,"It's all right, I got some great candy for you."
607,3506379,3511008,"I got Special K, angel dust,
I got your all-time favourite."
608,3511801,3515888,And I got the newest of the new - R2.
609,3516013,3520810,"This shit's all the rage. You take two
of these, you go straight to heaven."
610,3520935,3522395,I'm not into chemicals.
611,3522520,3526148,"Oh, Cristi, you're not a cuddly
little kitty now, are you?"
612,3526273,3529026,"If you don't like 'em, you don't pay for 'em."
613,3533906,3535533,That's my girl.
614,3535658,3537368,It's busy.
615,3541539,3544375,"Hey, go easy on the booze tonight, right?"
616,3573654,3576198,What the fuck are you?
617,3580911,3583247,What the fuck are you doing?
618,3600347,3601807,"- Would you get my car, please?
- Sure."
619,3601932,3603851,"- What do you care, asshole?
- Let me get you a cab."
620,3603976,3606061,"- I don't need a fucking taxi.
- Hand me the glass, ma'am."
621,3606187,3607897,There's your fucking glass.
622,3610191,3612026,You OK?
623,3612151,3615154,"Stupid fucking asshole, move your car!"
624,3615279,3617156,I'm fine! Get away from my car!
625,3617281,3619867,"There's no damage, OK?
There's no damage."
626,3619992,3622119,"Excuse me, I know her,
I can drive her home."
627,3622244,3626457,"- Is this any of your business?
- I'm your friend Paul, from the sports club."
628,3627625,3629877,"- Yeah, well
- Remember?"
629,3630753,3634423,"Yeah, well, can you tell these assholes
to get away from me?"
630,3634548,3638135,"I'll drive her home, it's not a big deal. OK?"
631,3639637,3642932,"- You can't drive like this.
- What do you care?"
632,3644183,3646644,"You're going to get arrested,
let me drive you."
633,3647311,3649230,Please?
634,3653234,3655236,Damn it.
635,3808639,3811058,I sold the truck to pay for the lawyer.
636,3813018,3815229,I didn't ask for a lawyer.
637,3816814,3818357,"Marianne, I didn't ask for a lawyer."
638,3818482,3821318,"You want your children
to spend another two years without you?"
639,3821443,3823195,Is that what you want?
640,3823320,3825656,This is God's will.
641,3825781,3827700,So be it.
642,3828867,3831578,"Two years ago
you didn't believe in anything."
643,3831704,3834039,Now everything has to do with God.
644,3835332,3837042,"I think I preferred you
the way you were before."
645,3837167,3839211,I was a fucking pig before.
646,3839336,3842214,"- Is that what you prefer?
- At least it was you."
647,3842339,3846093,"Now I don't have the slightest fucking idea
who you are."
648,3848011,3851849,"Life has to go on, Jack.
With or without God."
649,3898020,3899772,"Hey, how are you doing?"
650,3899897,3901690,"- How are you?
- Fine."
651,3901815,3903609,Were you able to find anything out?
652,3903734,3905652,"Jack Jordan's living in a cheap motel,"
653,3905778,3909490,"lost out in the middle of nowhere.
Phone records."
654,3909615,3913285,"- One of his prison fishy pals is from there.
- That was quick."
655,3913410,3915704,Just a matter of checking the calls.
656,3916789,3919291,"Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in."
657,3922211,3927549,"Here's a pretty recent photo of Jordan,
it was taken the last time he was in jail."
658,3930260,3932763,"Were you about to get that other thing
that I asked about?"
659,3937851,3939770,This is a clean gun. No record.
660,3942064,3944274,We call this an orphan.
661,3944399,3945901,It is loaded.
662,3947486,3949780,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful there, hoss."
663,3950447,3954785,"You don't have to cock it, just pull the trigger
to shoot it. This releases the cylinder."
664,3957746,3960916,"I think we're set to go.
That's all I wanna know."
665,3962209,3964503,"- Thank you.
- Good luck to you."
666,3980310,3982813,"Ma'am, it's been an hour since I called."
667,3983647,3986525,"46, St. Vincent Street."
668,3987568,3989570,Thank you.
669,3992531,3995325,"- Hello.
- Hello."
670,3997411,3999371,Boy. Some rain.
671,4003542,4007880,"- Do you not have your car?
- No, but my taxi will be here in a minute."
672,4008589,4011383,"I'm right over here.
I can give you a lift if you like."
673,4011508,4013385,"No, thanks."
674,4019308,4021602,"I'm the guy who drove your car home
last week."
675,4025188,4027566,"I'm sorry, I don't remember."
676,4027691,4030027,I left my jacket with you.
677,4036200,4038035,Sorry.
678,4039369,4041955,"- I'll bring it by tomorrow.
- Are you sure I can't give you a ride?"
679,4042080,4044249,I'm right here.
680,4044374,4046084,Or do you want to swim?
681,4049296,4051298,OK.
682,4077950,4079952,Hello.
683,4105185,4107270,"- Thanks.
- You're very welcome."
684,4108355,4111733,Let me just give you my cell phone number.
685,4112275,4114611,So that you have it.
686,4120158,4122536,Would you have lunch with me tomorrow?
687,4124871,4126873,What for?
688,4128667,4132671,"You're going to have to eat at some point
and I'm very worried about those kidneys."
689,4134798,4138593,"Come on - Lawrence's, two o'clock?
It's very nearby."
690,4140804,4143640,"- Please?
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow."
691,4145809,4147769,Great.

701,4185098,4186349,Give me a call on my cell.
702,4186475,4188393,See you in a bit. Bye.
703,4188518,4190395,"- Good night, Mr Peck.
- Hey, Lucio."
704,4190520,4192147,Don't forget to do my garden on Saturday.
705,4192272,4194524,"No, sir, I won't forget."
706,4278275,4282195,"- Son of a bitch. What?
- Leave it to me, Marianne."

it doesn't. Everybody reacts differently."
708,4302090,4304342,That's why you've been vomiting so much.
709,4304467,4307637,"So what are we saying,
I've got to change medication?"
710,4309639,4311224,"OK, I'm going to be frank with you, Paul."
711,4311349,4314561,"The heart that you're carrying
is gonna give out soon."
712,4315812,4319816,"I need you to stay in the hospital
until I can find you another heart."
713,4321234,4325197,"- You want me to wait for a new heart?
- We don't have a lot of choice."
714,4329159,4331703,"I can't do that. I can't wait
for someone else to die"
715,4331828,4334289,locked up in a fucking room. I can't do it.
716,4334414,4338793,"You're dangerously close to heart failure,
Paul."
717,4339586,4341421,You might die
718,4342130,4344257,a lot sooner than you think.
719,4350138,4354476,"Let me ask you something.
I want you to be really honest with me, OK?"
720,4357270,4359272,If I stay
721,4360690,4362692,will I be saved?
722,4363693,4365487,I can't guarantee it.
723,4365612,4367614,"But if you don't come back
to the hospital,"
724,4367739,4370450,"you're condemning yourself
to a terrible death."
725,4370575,4372702,Your heart won't work any more.
726,4372827,4374746,"You'll die, asphyxiated."
727,4374871,4378250,"It's an awful death,
Paul, you can't imagine it."
728,4378375,4382837,"- At least here we can help you to
- You can help me die better."
729,4383505,4387342,"That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better."
730,4387467,4389761,"Well, I'm not going to do that."
731,4389886,4392556,OK? I'd rather die outside.
732,4394933,4396935,I'm not going to do it again.
733,4402774,4404776,How much did the lawyer charge?
734,4409656,4411950,"Marianne, how much did
the fucking lawyer charge?"
735,4412075,4414202,"- Enough.
- How much is enough, Marianne?"
736,4414327,4417789,"Enough so your children can remember
your fucking face."
737,4419291,4422669,"Keep asking stupid questions
and I'm getting out at the next corner."
738,4437434,4439603,"Hi, guys, we're home."
739,4440645,4443440,Daddy! Daddy! What did you bring us?
740,4444691,4448486,"- I brought you a kiss.
- You didn't bring me a present, huh?"
741,4448611,4450488,"No, just a kiss."
742,4450613,4452657,We made you a cake.
743,4452782,4455577,"- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Freddy put the icing on it."
744,4459789,4462208,"Freddy, are you going
to say hello to your father?"
745,4465587,4469341,"Freddy drew those for you.
I drew those ones."
746,4471801,4474429,"- Mommy made the cake.
- Come here."
747,4477599,4481061,"She did?
Come look at the cake, Daddy."
748,4491446,4493073,"Come on, Daddy."
749,4494157,4498453,"There is a number hidden in every act
of life, in every aspect of the universe."
750,4498578,4503291,"Fractals, matter There's a number
screaming to tell us something."
751,4504584,4506795,"- Am I boring you?
- No."
752,4507921,4509422,"No, I"
753,4511132,4513760,"- Sorry.
- I just I try to tell them"
754,4513885,4519391,"that numbers are a door to understanding
a mystery that's bigger than us."
755,4520183,4523395,"How two people, strangers, come to meet."
756,4524187,4528191,"There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer
that begins,"
757,4530652,4533905,«The earth turned to bring us closer.
758,4534698,4537701,«It turned on itself and in us
759,4537826,4541162,"«until it finally brought us together
in this dream. »"
760,4546543,4548378,That's beautiful.
761,4549295,4553174,"There are so many things that
have to happen for two people to meet"
762,4554175,4557554,Anyway that's what mathematics are.
763,4563059,4566813,"How long have you been swimming?
A few years."
764,4566938,4571651,"- It doesn't bore you?
- No. It's what makes me feel normal."
765,4571776,4575905,"If I didn't swim or walk or do something,
I think I'd go crazy."
766,4577115,4578908,Thanks for lunch.
767,4579993,4582078,Yeah. Goodbye.
768,4584080,4585790,Do you want to come in?
769,4585915,4589127,"No, thanks Yes, I do want to come in."
770,4662075,4663701,Hey.
771,4664118,4666246,Can I ask you something?
772,4667872,4671960,"OK, I have a gun, OK? Don't look at me.
Don't look at me. I'll shoot you."
773,4672085,4673962,"- I don't have any money.
- Turn around."
774,4674087,4678341,"- Just turn around. Go. Walk. Walk.
- Hey, come on."
775,4678466,4680802,"- Put them up. Put your hands up.
- Why?"
776,4680927,4681886,Wait.
777,4682011,4684597,Just walk. Go.
778,4684722,4686724,"- We're gonna go down that path right there.
- Sir"
779,4686850,4690270,"- Do what I say and then you won't get hurt.
- Please. I don't have"
780,4690395,4691980,I'm not looking
781,4692105,4694607,"Come on, keep walking.
Just go right down here."
782,4694732,4697569,"Just keep walking. I said don't look at me,
I'll shoot you in the head."
783,4697694,4698862,Keep your hands up!
784,4698987,4703366,"Walk. Look, over here, over here.
Hey. Come on."
785,4703491,4705368,"Don't look at me. OK, keep going."
786,4706035,4708288,"Stop. Stop. Right here, OK"
787,4708413,4711416,Stop. Turn around.
788,4711541,4714377,"Keep your hands on your head.
Keep your hands on your head!"
789,4714878,4718256,"G- G-Get Take your shoes off
and get down on your knees."
790,4719215,4721175,Take off your shoes.
791,4721551,4725847,"No, not that one! Just get down
on your knees! Get down on your knees!"
792,4726889,4728975,"Sir, please"
793,4732896,4734939,Shouldn't have done it.
794,4737609,4740403,"- Done what?
- You shouldn't have done it!"
795,4742071,4744657,Close your goddamn eyes!
796,4789035,4792747,"- She looked me in the eyes.
- What are you talking about?"
797,4798211,4800880,One of the girls that I killed.
798,4801005,4803007,She looked me in the eye.
799,4807303,4810139,She wanted to tell me something.
800,4813017,4814686,I left her.
801,4814811,4817021,I left her there.
802,4821567,4823611,I ran away.
803,4824946,4827532,"- No
- I ran away."
804,4827657,4831035,I ran away. I ran away.
805,4831160,4833246,Ran away.
806,4834330,4836791,Ran away.
807,4848261,4851139,"- You're sticking with red?
- Sure."
808,4893806,4895600,Are you OK?
809,4896559,4898394,Yeah.
810,4900897,4902899,"I, um"
811,4904734,4907111,"I'm sorry, I had a dizzy"
812,4907236,4909447,"Can I get you a glass of water
or something?"
813,4910698,4912617,I think I should go home.
814,4913367,4915369,"I'm sorry, I just"
815,4924045,4925963,"I like you a lot, Cristina."
816,4927715,4931677,"It's been a long time
since I liked someone so much."
817,4935723,4937767,Can I see you again?
818,4940102,4942105,I'm a married woman.
819,4944440,4946442,I figured.
820,4954116,4956619,"- Thanks.
- Goodbye."
821,4974178,4980059,"I got peace like a river
I got peace like a river"
822,4980184,4985523,I got peace like a river in my soul
823,4985648,4989694,"- Everybody!
- I got love like an ocean"
824,4989819,4992989,I got love like an ocean
825,4993114,4998619,I got love like an ocean in my soul
826,4999370,5005543,"I got joy like a fountain
I got joy like a fountain"
827,5005668,5011424,I got joy like a fountain in my soul
828,5011924,5015261,"Look, Daddy, these are the zebras
and these are the lions."
829,5015386,5017263,"- Very pretty.
- How could you draw a zoo"
830,5017388,5019181,"- if you've never been to one?
- I've seen them in"
831,5019307,5021142,Stop fighting.
832,5023477,5027106,"The lawyer called to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday."
833,5029734,5031903,"- If you want I'll go with you to church.
- Daddy"
834,5032028,5035531,"in school they said
you killed two girls and their daddy."
835,5035656,5037658,Is that true?
836,5038784,5040536,"- Yes.
- No."
837,5041370,5045166,Yes. He killed them.
838,5046208,5048544,"It was an accident, sweetie."
839,5049545,5051464,You understand?
840,5055468,5060056,"Oh, Jesus,
every time I look at my children"
841,5076155,5078074,Hello?
842,5079992,5081577,Hello?
843,5081702,5083537,Paul?
844,5088084,5090378,Who Who is this?
845,5090503,5092255,Cristina.
846,5094924,5096884,Did I wake you?
847,5097927,5100262,Hang on a second.
848,5105309,5107019,Hi.
849,5107812,5110731,"- Did I wake you?
- No, that's OK."
850,5112733,5116153,"Um, couldcould you come to my house?"
851,5118280,5121617,"- Is something wrong?
- No, I just"
852,5123077,5125413,I just want you to come if you can.
853,5126622,5129083,Or if you want to.
854,5129208,5130793,Yeah.
855,5130918,5133337,I'll be right there.
856,5133462,5135172,Thanks.
857,5135298,5136966,OK.
858,5140845,5143973,"It's two o'clock in the morning.
Who were you talking to?"
859,5144098,5146058,I won't be long.
860,5147226,5149020,Where are you going?
861,5149145,5153149,"- I said I won't be long.
- Exactly where and with who are you going?"
862,5155359,5158029,I thought you'd change after the transplant.
863,5158154,5160406,And I thought you'd change if I did.
864,5160531,5162533,Neither of us changed.
865,5214001,5216587,"- What's wrong?
- He's been shot in the chest."
866,5216712,5220716,"Come on.
Shot in the chest. Shot in the chest."
867,5221717,5224929,"- OK. How's long he's been like that?
- He's dying, OK?! We need a"
868,5225054,5227473,OK. I'll go get a stretcher.
869,5227598,5231352,"- Ma'am, he'll be right back.
- It's OK, baby."
870,5232895,5235147,I shot him.
871,5235272,5237358,"- I don't have the gun.
- You did what?"
872,5237483,5240903,"- I shot him.
- Control, I need you to call the police."
873,5241654,5244573,"It's an emergency, yes. I'm right out front."
874,5256043,5257545,Hi.
875,5260714,5263050,Are you OK?
876,5268431,5269723,Cristina.
877,5272935,5275104,You kept me thinking all day.
878,5277148,5281318,"You see, I haven't spoken
to anyone in months"
879,5281444,5283863,and I barely know you
880,5283988,5287783,and I already need to talk to you.
881,5289994,5291871,And
882,5293956,5298043,"there's something the more I think about,
the less I understand."
883,5301297,5304300,"Why the hell did you tell me
that you liked me?"
884,5306969,5310264,"Answer me, because
I didn't like you saying that at all."
885,5313601,5317813,"You can't just walk up to a woman
you barely know and tell her you like her."
886,5317938,5321609,"You can't do that,
you don't know what she's going through."
887,5322151,5324320,Or what she's feeling.
888,5327239,5329241,I'm not married.
889,5330284,5331744,I
890,5336790,5339376,"- It's OK.
-"
891,5341337,5343547,"- I'm sorry.
- No."
892,5375037,5377414,Cristina Wait.
893,5378332,5380251,"- I have to tell you something.
- OK."
894,5380376,5382253,"- Please.
- Kiss me."
895,5382378,5384129,"Wait, Cristina."
896,5385005,5386882,Cristina
897,5389718,5392137,I have Michael's heart.
898,5393555,5395599,"- What?
- I have Michael's heart."
899,5397893,5400271,You understand what I'm saying?
900,5400396,5404733,"It was transplanted into me
at St. Francis Hospital on October 11th."
901,5405442,5406819,No.
902,5406944,5410364,"I tried to tell you,
I just didn't know how to tell you."
903,5410489,5412157,How dare you?
904,5413075,5416495,How dare you? How fucking dare you?!
905,5416620,5419415,"- I'm here for a reason.
- Get out of my house!"
906,5420916,5423961,Don't touch me! Get out of my house now!
907,5424086,5427006,"- You make me sick!
- I'm here for a reason! Can't you see that?"
908,5427131,5428716,Get out of my fucking
909,5428841,5432469,"Get the fuck out of my house,
you make me sick!"
910,5432594,5434263,Get out!
911,5501413,5503415,Good morning.
912,5513550,5515719,Why did you look for me?
913,5519223,5521642,Because I needed to.
914,5522851,5525562,I don't want your fucking pity.
915,5527439,5529274,That wasn't it.
916,5536949,5539868,"I was sick, Cristina, I was very sick."
917,5542955,5546792,"I was dying when Michael
gave me his heart."
918,5550963,5552881,He saved my life.
919,5558887,5562516,"I tried in every way I knew how
to find out"
920,5563225,5565811,who had given me this heart.
921,5565936,5570232,"And that's how I found out
how he and your daughters had died."
922,5575571,5578824,"It's very painful for me to know
how I got this heart."
923,5580743,5582828,I couldn't sleep.
924,5583871,5587458,"I just I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to help in some way."
925,5587583,5589877,I just wanted to thank you for
926,5595549,5597509,But I couldn't find you.
927,5601597,5603432,And then I saw you
928,5605100,5607102,that day.
929,5610606,5613192,And now I can't be away from you.
930,5616904,5618906,I can't.
931,5626455,5628874,You don't have to be afraid.
932,5631543,5633879,I've got a good heart.
933,5650646,5652564,I'm scared too.
934,5762466,5764134,"Why did you leave us, Jack? Why?"
935,5764259,5765510,I'm where I have to be.
936,5765636,5767596,Gina got really sick because of the hamster
937,5767721,5770974,"- The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.
- Jack, we need you here."
938,5771099,5773268,Back when I was me.
939,5773393,5778398,"- But the decisions I make, that's my mirror.
- What are you talking about?"
940,5778523,5780275,That's my mirror.
941,5780400,5783987,"- It doesn't matter.
- And I have to live with them alone."
942,5784112,5786948,"- Come back to us.
- I can't erase it."
943,5787074,5790202,"- Your family needs you.
- No one can erase it."
944,5790327,5793372,"Jack, please."
945,5799878,5803340,"We need to stabilise him
before we can get him to the hospital."
946,5803465,5807219,"Right now, what we really need
are units of B-positive blood."
947,5807344,5809513,"I'm O-positive, will that work?"
948,5809638,5812140,"OK, open and close your fist several times."
949,5919080,5921291,Go ahead.
950,5924836,5926838,"OK, pal."
951,5926963,5929466,You're free to go for lack of evidence.
952,5931635,5935514,"Your story doesn't check out,
it contradicts our investigation"
953,5935639,5939309,"and the statements made
by Mrs Peck and Mr Rivers."
954,5940102,5942104,I just need you to sign here.
955,5942729,5944773,What if I really am guilty?
956,5945357,5947567,"Yeah, well, it happens."
957,5947984,5951238,"It won't be the first time, won't be the last."
958,6014384,6016386,What are you doing?
959,6016511,6020515,"You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?"
960,6021266,6023351,"Mary, I don't want a fight."
961,6023476,6025061,I want this to end well.
962,6025187,6028189,"Oh, you think ending well
means disappearing for a few days?"
963,6029107,6032569,"You just waited till you got better
to tell me to fuck off."
964,6032694,6034571,I'm going back to London.
965,6034696,6037407,"- You can't keep doing this.
- Really?"
966,6037532,6040410,"I'll have surgery
and I'll be inseminated with your child."
967,6040535,6043163,"- With or without you.
- Mary, what for?"
968,6043288,6045290,"- Why?
- Because I want to."
969,6047042,6049210,"- Well, I won't authorise that.
- Oh, no?"
970,6049336,6051254,"- No.
- Well, you already have."
971,6051379,6054591,"I have a signed copy of your authorization
to use your semen. Would you excuse me?"
972,6054716,6057344,"- What do you gain?
- I get what I want."
973,6057469,6060388,"You decide if you come
looking for me or not."
974,6172584,6174210,"Hi, honey, I'm on my way home."
975,6174336,6176629,"If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me"
976,6176755,6180675,"- Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.
-"
977,6180800,6184012,"Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye."
978,6184137,6188349,"To repeat the message, press one.
To delete, press two."
979,6190351,6192062,"Hi, honey, I'm on my way home."
980,6192187,6194397,"If you need me to pick up anything
along the way, let me"
981,6194522,6198902,"Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it."
982,6199027,6201863,"Give me a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye."
983,6289951,6291828,"I'm grilling some chicken.
You want anything to eat?"
984,6291953,6293997,"No, thanks."
985,6294122,6295999,I could make you a sandwich
986,6296124,6298293,"No. No, no, no. No!"
987,6300295,6302046,"Cristina, Cristina,"
988,6302172,6303798,listen to me.
989,6304340,6307010,You don't need that shit. You need
990,6307135,6310054,Don't tell me what I need.
991,6353056,6355183,Katie could have lived.
992,6357227,6358686,What?
993,6360063,6363733,"She'd be alive right now,
but that bastard left her there."
994,6365860,6368279,Lying in the street.
995,6368404,6373368,"He left the three of them like animals.
He didn't care."
996,6377413,6379666,At least she could be here with me.
997,6380917,6383920,That son of a bitch is walking the streets.
998,6384045,6387882,"- And I can't even go into their room.
- He's walking the streets?"
999,6391261,6393179,I want to kill him.
1000,6393304,6395431,You want to kill him?
1001,6395556,6399602,"I'm gonna kill Jack Jordan.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch."
1002,6399727,6404399,"- Slow down, Cristina, just slow down.
- Slow down? Slow down?"
1003,6404524,6407527,"- While I what, huh? While I what?!
- Take it easy."
1004,6407652,6411197,"Take it easy? My husband
and my little girls are dead"
1005,6411322,6413658,and I'm supposed to take it fucking easy?!
1006,6414367,6417245,I can't just go on with my life!
1007,6417370,6423042,"I am paralyzed here,
I am a fucking amputee, do you see that?!"
1008,6423585,6425503,Who are you?!
1009,6425628,6429465,"You owe it to Michael.
No, you've got his heart,"
1010,6429590,6433553,"you're in his house, fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair!"
1011,6433678,6436431,"- We have to kill him!
- Not like this."
1012,6436556,6438933,"Then how, tell me how!"
1013,6458077,6460079,Katie died
1014,6461748,6464208,with red shoelaces on.
1015,6464334,6467128,She hated red shoelaces.
1016,6470173,6473009,"And she kept asking me
to get her some blue ones"
1017,6473134,6475845,and I never got her the blue ones.
1018,6477597,6481809,"She was wearing those fucking
red shoelaces when she was killed."
1019,6499702,6501245,You shouldn't have done it.
1020,6501371,6504332,Close yourclose your goddamn eyes!
1021,6514675,6517553,You murderer.
1022,6517679,6520348,You just let them lie there on the street.
1023,6520473,6525520,"Those two little girls, you just let them die
like dogs. I should have killed you."
1024,6527688,6531401,"Now you disappear. Don't even
go back to the motel and get your things."
1025,6533152,6535113,Just disappear.
1026,6574235,6576571,Mrs Peck.
1027,6576696,6578030,How is he?
1028,6578156,6581451,"We weren't able to use your blood
for his transfusion."
1029,6581576,6585079,"We found very high levels
of illegal substances in your blood."
1030,6585204,6587874,"- You're taking very high risks here.
- Well, that's my problem."
1031,6587999,6591377,"In your state, I suggest you stop
using these substances."
1032,6592795,6596257,"- What are you talking about?
- You're pregnant, Mrs Peck."
1033,6601637,6603306,You're sure?
1034,6603431,6606642,"You really need to start
taking care of yourself, Mrs Peck."
1035,6606767,6609979,"We'll let you know when Mr Rivers
is out of the OR."
1036,6661948,6663950,Where were you?
1037,6668287,6670289,Did you kill him?
1038,6671165,6672875,Did you?
1039,6682093,6684303,Why didn't you wake me up?
1040,6685680,6687682,Where's the body?
1041,6688724,6690726,Nobody will ever find the body.
1042,6722049,6724385,I'm sorry.
1043,6724510,6726512,We're gonna go home now.
1044,6728180,6730975,"Let's just get out of here, OK? Yeah?"
1045,6734895,6738024,"It's OK, baby. Just lie down."
1046,6740151,6742820,"- I need to rest. I need to rest.
- I know."
1047,6743613,6745448,I know.
1048,6746949,6748951,I'm sorry.
1049,6753372,6755374,I love you.
1050,6757543,6760588,I love you. I love you.
1051,6790660,6792662,Wake up.
1052,6795665,6797667,There's somebody outside.
1053,6829240,6831826,"Oh, my God!"
1054,6832326,6835204,"- Oh, my God.
- You want to kill me?"
1055,6836831,6839917,"- What's he doing here?
- Here I am."
1056,6841168,6842795,Shoot me.
1057,6842920,6846549,Quick
1058,6846674,6849301,"Oh, my God."
1059,6849427,6851470,Do something!
1060,6901145,6902938,"No, baby. Oh, no"
1061,6903063,6904607,"No, no"
1062,6904732,6908152,"Oh, my God! Baby baby"
1063,6908277,6910279,"Oh, my God."
1064,6911447,6914241,Baby
1065,6920247,6924001,"Oh, God! Call an ambulance."
1066,6927046,6929757,Call a fucking ambulance!
1067,6952822,6955658,How many lives do we live?
1068,6956826,6959161,How many times do we die?
1069,6964542,6971215,"They say we all lose 21 grams
at the exact moment of our death."
1070,6971340,6973342,Everyone.
1071,6975469,6979056,And how much fits into 21 grams?
1072,6984061,6986063,How much is lost?
1073,6996615,6999326,When do we lose 21 grams?
1074,7014049,7016176,How much goes with them?
1075,7030649,7032651,How much is gained?
1076,7042494,7045915,How much is gained?
1077,7057343,7059929,21 grams.
1078,7060054,7063974,"The weight of a stack of five nickels,"
1079,7064099,7066477,the weight of a hummingbird.
1080,7067645,7069688,A chocolate bar.
1081,7071607,7073901,How much do 21 grams weigh?
1082,7098676,7101136,To Maria Eladia.
1083,7101261,7105808,"When what was lost was burned,
the corn fields became green again"
1084,7237481,7240150,One last kiss
1085,7240275,7243237,One only
1086,7244113,7246573,Then I'd let you go
1087,7249159,7252204,Hard for you
1088,7252329,7254706,I've fallen
1089,7255624,7258585,But you can break my fall
1090,7261130,7264007,I'm broken
1091,7264133,7266760,Don't break me
1092,7268053,7270430,When I hit the ground
1093,7272766,7275727,Some devil
1094,7275853,7278605,Some angel
1095,7279565,7283026,Has got me to the bones
1096,7284778,7291034,You said always and for ever
1097,7292369,7296498,"Now I believe you, baby"
1098,7296623,7302963,You said always and for ever
1099,7304173,7308635,"Is such a long, lonely time"
1100,7320981,7323817,Too drunk and
1101,7323942,7326695,Still drinking
1102,7327905,7330699,It's just the way I feel
1103,7333327,7335871,It's all right
1104,7335996,7338832,That's what you told me
1105,7339917,7344338,'Cause what we had was so beautiful
1106,7345172,7348300,I feel heavy
1107,7348425,7351011,Like floating
1108,7351845,7356808,At the bottom of the sea
1109,7356934,7363106,You said always and for ever
1110,7364733,7368654,"Now I believe you, baby"
1111,7368779,7375077,You said always and for ever
1112,7376536,7381708,"Is such a long, lonely time"
1113,7393512,7396265,Some devil is
1114,7396390,7399393,Stuck inside of me
1115,7400227,7404273,I cannot set it free
1116,7404398,7411238,"I wish, I wish I was dead
and you were breathing"
1117,7412239,7414992,Just so that you could know
1118,7417327,7420372,Some angel is
1119,7420497,7424001,Stuck inside of me
1120,7424126,7427296,I cannot set you free
1121,7429381,7435387,You said always and for ever
1122,7437055,7441268,"Now I believe you, baby"
1123,7441393,7447357,You said always and for ever
1124,7449401,7454281,"Such a long, lonely time"
1125,7456700,7459369,Stuck inside of me
