533,1872300,1873836,How long would I be gone?
534,1874803,1876105,Hard to know.
535,1876572,1877573,Years?
536,1878374,1879708,"I've got kids, Professor."
537,1880776,1882378,Get out there and save them.
538,1885981,1887683,"Who's ""they""?"
539,1887716,1889985,"We started detecting
gravitational anomalies"
540,1890018,1891920,almost 50 years ago.
541,1891954,1893888,"Mostly small distortions
to our instruments"
542,1893922,1895557,in the upper atmosphere.
543,1895591,1898461,"In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself."
544,1899261,1901196,"Yeah, over the Straits."

546,1903465,1904800,"Something tripped
my fly-by-wire."
547,1905367,1906534,Exactly.
548,1907770,1912441,"But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this."
549,1912475,1913475,"Out near Saturn,"
550,1914910,1916679,a disturbance of spacetime.
551,1918880,1920682,Is that a wormhole?
552,1920715,1922217,It appeared 48 years ago.
553,1922250,1924320,And it leads where?
554,1924920,1926489,Another galaxy.
555,1928390,1930759,"A wormhole's not a naturally
occurring phenomenon."
556,1930792,1931861,Someone placed it there.
557,1933028,1934996,"- ""They""?
- Mmm-hmm."
558,1935030,1936965,"And whoever they are,"
559,1936999,1939501,"they appear to be
looking out for us."
560,1939534,1942337,"That wormhole
lets us travel
to other stars."
561,1942371,1944406,"It came along
right as we needed it."
562,1944440,1946008,"They've put potentially
habitable worlds"
563,1946041,1947541,right within our reach.
564,1947575,1949912,"Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes."
565,1949945,1951063,You sent probes into that?
566,1951064,1952181,Mmm-hmm.

593,2015944,2016944,Okay.
594,2017946,2019982,"So if we find a home,"
595,2022817,2024053,then what?
596,2024086,2025921,That's the long shot.
597,2026621,2030458,There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

602,2051046,2053181,PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. Plan A.
603,2053214,2055484,"How do you get it
off the ground?"
604,2055517,2059521,"The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything."
605,2059553,2064057,"Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real."
606,2064091,2066628,So I started working on a theory
607,2066662,2069097,"and we started
building this station."
608,2069131,2070899,But you haven't solved it yet.
609,2072267,2073569,That's why there's Plan B.

611,2076404,2079074,"How to get a viable amount of

617,2090919,2093354,"With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10."
618,2093388,2095390,"After that, with surrogacy,"
619,2095423,2096992,the growth becomes exponential.
620,2097960,2099494,"Within 30 years,"
621,2099528,2101363,"we could have
a colony of hundreds."
622,2101396,2103164,"The real difficulty
with colonization"
623,2103198,2104466,is genetic diversity.
624,2105300,2107536,This takes care of that.
625,2107569,2109471,"But what about

2558,9253407,9254876,COOPER: What happens now?
2559,9317471,9318874,DOCTOR: Mr. Cooper.
2560,9323210,9325279,"Let's take it slow, sir."
2561,9325312,9327716,"Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper."
2562,9327749,9329650,"Remember, you're
no spring chicken anymore."
2563,9329684,9331887,"Actually, you are 124 years old."
2564,9336191,9338126,"(PEOPLE PLAYING BASEBALL

2565,9339527,9340929,"Take it slow, sir."
2566,9342129,9344699,You were extremely lucky.
2567,9344732,9346277,"The Rangers found you
with only minutes left"
2568,9346301,9347836,in your oxygen supply.

2571,9362016,9363151,Where am I?
2572,9365186,9366721,DOCTOR: Cooper Station.
2573,9368222,9369324,Currently orbiting Saturn.
2574,9371493,9373228,Cooper Station.
2575,9376331,9378165,Nice of you to name it after me.
2576,9378199,9379200,(LAUGHS)
2577,9381903,9383437,What?
2578,9383471,9384815,"The station
isn't named after you, sir."
2579,9384839,9386841,It's named after your daughter.
2580,9386875,9388643,Although she's always maintained
2581,9388676,9390144,just how important you were.
2582,9390177,9391680,Is she still alive?
2583,9393547,9394827,"She'll be here
in a couple weeks."
2584,9396551,9397885,She is far too old
2585,9397918,9399162,"to be transferring
from another station,"
2586,9399186,9401690,"but when she heard
that you'd been found..."
2587,9402691,9403891,"Well, this is..."
2588,9403924,9405564,"This is Murphy Cooper
we're talking about."
2589,9406394,9407696,"Yes, it is."
2590,9410465,9412968,"DOCTOR: We'll have you checked
out of here in a couple days."
2591,9415303,9417638,"I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store."
2592,9419240,9423444,"I actually did a paper on you
in high school."
2593,9423477,9425614,"I know all about your life
back on Earth."
2594,9427281,9428283,"Oh, yeah."
2595,9428583,9429818,Right.
2596,9432753,9434055,"If you'll follow me,"
2597,9434088,9436958,"we've got a really
good situation for you."
2598,9441162,9444398,"So, um, when I made
my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,"
2599,9446200,9448403,"I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect."
2600,9452073,9453317,"OLD WOMAN 1:
It was just constant."
2601,9453341,9455877,Just that steady blow of dirt.
2602,9455910,9458780,"Of course, I didn't
speak to her personally."
2603,9458813,9460815,"We always
set the plate upside-down."
2604,9460848,9464050,"Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down."
2605,9464085,9468956,"My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else
back then."
2606,9468989,9471826,There just wasn't enough food.
2607,9471859,9474428,"OLD WOMAN 2: We wore
little things, little strips"
2608,9474462,9478666,"of sheet, put it sometimes
over our nose and mouth,"
2609,9478700,9480010,"so we wouldn't
breathe so much of it."
2610,9480034,9483271,"Well, it was pretty exciting
for me because it was hope."
2611,9483304,9485206,"OLD MAN: I don't care
who describes it,"
2612,9485240,9487742,"there is no way for it to be
exaggerated. It was that bad."
2613,9487775,9489510,"ADMINISTRATOR:
She did confirm"
2614,9489544,9491679,just how much you loved farming.
2615,9491712,9493414,"- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah."
2616,9493448,9495216,Here we are.
2617,9495250,9496950,Home sweet home.
2618,9496984,9499854,"Everything replaced
and put back where it..."
2619,9506461,9507528,"Hey, is this..."
2620,9507561,9509130,"Oh, yeah."
2621,9509163,9511966,"The machine we found
out near Saturn
when we found you, yes."
2622,9511999,9513701,"Its power source was shot,"
2623,9513735,9515045,"but we could get you
another one if you want it."
2624,9515069,9516471,Yes. Please.

2637,9552306,9553440,Knock-knock.
2638,9553474,9554908,You want 55?
2639,9560181,9562350,"TARS: Is this really
what it was like?"
2640,9564719,9566988,"It was never this clean,
Slick. (CHUCKLES)"
2641,9571426,9573260,I don't care much for this
2642,9573294,9574929,"pretending we're back
where we started."
2643,9577365,9579200,I want to know where we are.
2644,9581236,9582403,Where we're going.
2645,9587208,9589511,"Mr. Cooper.
The family's all in there."
2646,9590444,9591779,Family?
2647,9591813,9593246,"Yeah, they all came out
to see her."
2648,9593281,9595283,"She's been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years."

2650,9628682,9630451,You told 'em I like farming.

2652,9636457,9637925,"It was me, Murph."
2653,9640661,9642197,I was your ghost.
2654,9643631,9644966,I know.
2655,9647135,9648903,People didn't believe me.
2656,9648936,9651406,"They thought that
I was doing it all myself."
2657,9652040,9653074,But...
2658,9655810,9657345,I knew who it was.
2659,9662783,9664352,Nobody believed me.
2660,9665619,9667388,But I knew you'd come back.
2661,9670224,9671226,How?
2662,9673694,9676231,Because my dad promised me.
2663,9682770,9684505,"Well, I'm here now, Murph."
2664,9685806,9687108,I'm here.
2665,9688709,9689911,No.
2666,9692546,9695916,"No parent should have to
watch their own child die."
2667,9699287,9701322,I have my kids here for me now.
2668,9704525,9705660,You go.
2669,9709363,9710398,Where?
2670,9714368,9715536,Brand.
2671,9725146,9726948,"She's out there,"
2672,9733120,9734589,setting up camp.
2673,9761882,9763184,Alone
2674,9764885,9766720,in a strange galaxy.
2675,9778533,9782737,"Maybe right now she's
settling in for the long nap"
2676,9801289,9803624,by the light of our new sun
2677,9819573,9821274,in our new home.
