500,2444265,2448082,You are a good man.
501,2449541,2452586,"- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did."
502,2452711,2456236,"- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on."
503,2457549,2460427,God bless you.
504,2472398,2475088,"I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but
you're running very late."
505,2475171,2478696,"This is for the major, sir."
506,2478821,2481740,"And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday."
507,2481824,2484535,"- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again."
508,2484660,2487204,"Go. Go, go, drive. Don't bow."
509,2487329,2490269,"Did you notice that
man had one arm?"
510,2490270,2491270,Did he?
511,2494962,2498173,"- What's his use?
- Very useful."
512,2500342,2504138,"- How?
- Very useful. Success."
513,2532604,2534647,"You'll be given
brooms and shovels..."
514,2534668,2537713,"each of you will grab one and
start cleaning the street."
515,2537796,2540799,We'll be late for work.
516,2552311,2555356,"You shouldn't think of
them as yours, Oskar."
517,2555481,2557378,"You need to understand that
some of the officers here..."
518,2557399,2560235,"don't give a damn
about production."
519,2560361,2564406,"To them, it's a matter
of, national priority..."
520,2564531,2566888,that Jews be made to shovel snow.
521,2566950,2569411,"It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar."
522,2569495,2571580,You know it and I know it.
523,2571664,2573916,Jews shovelling snow.
524,2573999,2578712,"It's got a, ritual significance."
525,2580381,2583801,"- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker."
526,2583926,2586595,"- Essential worker?
- Yes."
527,2589556,2591041,I work for Oskar Schindler.
528,2591042,2593143,"Essential worker for
Oskar Schindler."
529,2593227,2595791,A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless.
530,2595792,2596792,"Yes, yes."
531,2597293,2600734,"I lost a day of production, Rolf."
532,2600859,2603988,I work for Oskar Schindler.
533,2604530,2608117,"Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow."
534,2612246,2616000,"I lost a worker. I expect
to be compensated."
535,2616125,2619003,"File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right."
536,2619128,2622819,"- Would it do any good?
- Of course not."
537,2624800,2626437,A big shot from the SS Budget and
538,2626438,2628324,"Construction Office
came to lunch..."
539,2628345,2630393,and he told us that to believe the
540,2630394,2632683,"Jewish skilled worker
had a place..."
541,2632850,2637479,"in Reich economics was
a treasonable idea."
542,2641087,2645696,"A one-armed machinist, Oskar?"
543,2645717,2648761,He was a metal press operator.
544,2652515,2654872,Quite skilled.
545,2683901,2685944,Mr Director.
546,2686028,2688405,Shit. I don't believe it.
547,2688530,2690741,"Stern, is that you?"
548,2690866,2694953,"No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern."
549,2695454,2698916,"Leave your luggage
on the platform."
550,2699041,2701085,Clearly label it.
551,2701210,2705381,"Given name first,
then your surname."
552,2705464,2708050,"Do not bring your
baggage with you."
553,2708133,2711011,It will follow you later.
554,2711136,2714452,"Leave your luggage
on the platform."
555,2714536,2716329,Clearly label it.
556,2716412,2720437,"Leave your luggage
on the platform."
557,2721397,2722815,Stern?
558,2725484,2728570,"- He's on the list.
- He is?"
559,2728654,2731532,"- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him."
560,2731657,2733130,"He's on the list. If
he were an essential"
561,2733131,2734430,"worker, he would not
be on the list."
562,2734451,2737371,"I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?"
563,2737496,2740541,"- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list."
564,2740562,2744712,"- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber."
565,2745254,2746839,Tauber.
566,2746860,2750759,"Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made."
567,2750780,2753554,"My plant manager is
somewhere on this train."
568,2753699,2755533,"If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production..."
569,2755535,2757704,"and the Armaments Board
will want to know why."
570,2757787,2759524,"Attention. The train
is about to leave."
571,2759525,2760525,Is he on the list?
572,2760526,2764690,"Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern."
573,2764773,2770529,"Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do."
574,2770550,2773490,"- What is your name?
- Close and secure all doors."
575,2773615,2776994,"- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving."
576,2777161,2779455,"- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder."
577,2779580,2781540,"- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?"
578,2781623,2783751,Schindler. S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.
579,2783792,2786170,"Gentlemen, thank you very much."
580,2786295,2788881,"I think I can guarantee
you you'll both be in..."
581,2788964,2792676,"Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day."
582,2795804,2797765,Stern.
583,2797848,2799767,"- Stern.
- Stern."
584,2799892,2801852,Itzhak Stern.
585,2808233,2810903,Stern. Itzhak Stern.
586,2810986,2813697,"- Stern. Stern.
- Itzhak Stern."
587,2815074,2818452,"- Stern.
- Sir."
588,2820266,2822706,"- Stern.
- Herr Direktor."
589,2823770,2825668,My apologies.
590,2825751,2828671,"- Stop the train. He's here.
- I apologise."
591,2828754,2833717,"- Stop the train.
- Stop the train. Stop it."
592,2846167,2850025,Sign here. Initial there.
593,2850150,2854509,"Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one."
594,2854905,2856865,"It's the inconvenience
to the list."
595,2856991,2858268,It's the paperwork.
596,2858269,2860703,"I somehow left my
work card at home."
597,2860786,2864540,"I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but..."
598,2864623,2866222,"I'm sorry, it was stupid."
599,2866223,2868711,"What if I got here
five minutes later?"
600,2868794,2871505,Then where would I be?
601,2982992,2985536,"I woke up from a
dream this morning."
602,2985661,2989873,"I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know..."
603,2990040,2993152,"only to discover I was
broke and sharing"
604,2993153,2995963,"a room with 12 people
I didn't know."
605,2996380,2998674,"- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh."
606,2998757,3001385,You are living behind walls.
607,3001468,3004013,The walls I can deal with.
608,3004014,3006557,"It's the restrictions to
my life I'm tired of."
609,3006682,3009289,"Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about."
610,3009310,3012563,"I like it here. There's a
kind of, I don't know..."
611,3012688,3014940,ancestral squalor to it all.
612,3015024,3017192,"- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more."
613,3017276,3019403,"- I'm smart.
- Oh, yes, you're smart."
614,3019570,3021780,"- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance."
615,3021864,3026493,"Today, today I actually found
time to organise a thought."
616,3026660,3029371,"I can't remember the
last time I did that."
617,3029455,3031248,When's the last time we did this?
618,3031332,3033834,"When's the last time we
stood around and talked?"
619,3033959,3037254,"No one ordered me
onto a truck today."
620,3037379,3039590,"No one took my
business away from me."
621,3039715,3041717,"You don't really have
a business to take."
622,3041800,3044094,There's nowhere down from here.
623,3044219,3046430,This is it. This is the bottom.
624,3046555,3050476,"The ghetto is, liberty."
625,3056482,3059777,"This street divides the
ghetto just about in half."
626,3060319,3065240,"Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees..."
627,3065324,3068202,industrial workers and so on.
628,3068327,3073311,"Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour..."
629,3073749,3076126,the elderly and infirm mostly.
630,3076147,3078629,"Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?"
631,3078796,3081110,"Do you have any questions, sir?"
632,3081173,3084551,"Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing."
633,3086325,3089140,"We expect a labour force
of 25.000 to 30.000."
634,3089141,3092582,"Segregated of course. The men in
the barracks near the guarry..."
635,3092685,3094435,"the women on the other
side of the wire."
636,3094436,3095436,My place is where?
637,3095437,3097168,"- There, sir.
- There?"
638,3097189,3100067,"- Yes, the villa.
- You call that a villa?"
639,3100088,3102173,"- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa."
640,3102194,3104979,"We' to turn it into
the camp stables."
641,3104980,3106094,It's a house.
642,3106177,3109222,What's that over there?
643,3109910,3112579,Playground. Fifty-one.
644,3112705,3117251,"And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians."
645,3119482,3123007,"There they are, sir."
646,3126927,3130681,"One of you is, a very lucky girl."
647,3130806,3134560,There is an opening for a job...
648,3134643,3138522,"away from all this,
backbreaking work..."
649,3138647,3142192,at my new villa.
650,3145758,3149888,"Which of you has
domestic experience?"
651,3152765,3157082,"Yeah, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid."
652,3157145,3160586,"All those annoying
habits I have to undo."
653,3165341,3168260,I don't want to give you my cold.
654,3168490,3170387,What's your name?
655,3170512,3172890,"- Helen Hirsch.
- What?"
656,3172973,3174767,Helen Hirsch.
657,3174850,3179521,"- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch."
658,3194953,3197539,"- Yes.
- Take it all down."
659,3197623,3199729,"- Back to your work.
- To work."
660,3199813,3203921,Take it down. It is not safe.
661,3203962,3207383,"She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down."
662,3207466,3210552,"I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa."
663,3210636,3214890,"Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch."
664,3214974,3219228,"Herr Kommandant. The
entire foundation..."
665,3219311,3222064,has to be torn down and repoured.
666,3222147,3225567,"If not, there will be at
least a subsidence..."
667,3225651,3228237,"at the southern end
of the barracks."
668,3228320,3230906,"Subsidence, and then collapse."
669,3230990,3233742,"- And you are an engineer?
- Yes."
670,3233826,3236245,"My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate..."
671,3236370,3238706,"of Civil Engineering from
the University of Milan."
672,3238789,3243252,"Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself."
673,3250592,3254013,"- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir."
674,3254138,3258142,"- Shoot her.
- What?"
675,3258267,3262771,"Commander. I'm only
trying to do my job."
676,3262855,3264440,"Yeah, I'm doing mine."
677,3264523,3266984,"Sir, she's foreman
of construction."
678,3267151,3269486,"We are not going to have
arguments with these people."
679,3270029,3271572,Okay.
680,3273115,3276952,"No. Shoot her here,
on my authority."
681,3287629,3292760,"- It will take more than that.
- I'm sure, you are right."
682,3299308,3304188,"Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said."
683,3304313,3308525,"We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light."
684,3319328,3322873,Today is history.
685,3323415,3326794,Today will be remembered.
686,3327586,3334677,"Years from now, the young will
ask with wonder about this day."

you are part of it."

the blame for the Black Death..."

691,3350776,3354071,"told the Jews they
could come to Krakow."
692,3354092,3356740,"- Chaja, bread.
- They came."
693,3356865,3358409,"Not that fat. No, less."
694,3358410,3359952,"They trundled their
belongings into the city."
695,3360035,3362871,"- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled..."
696,3363059,3367668,they took hold. They prospered...
697,3367793,3372840,"in business, science,
education, the arts."
698,3372965,3375947,They came here with nothing.
699,3376656,3378178,Nothing.
700,3379305,3381890,And they flourished.
701,3381974,3387688,"For six centuries there
has been a Jewish Krakow."
702,3388334,3390983,Think about that.
703,3391066,3393110,By this evening...
704,3393152,3397406,those six centuries are a rumour.
705,3398052,3400993,They never happened.

707,3424829,3427811,Get off and line up in a two row.
708,3428771,3431252,"Come on, quicker."
709,3433922,3439427,"I think we will
start, with Ghetto B."
710,3447873,3450230,"- All right?
- Start from both sides?"
711,3450292,3452217,"No, no. I would like
you to start there."
712,3452218,3453218,The right side?
713,3453462,3455693,"- And then move around.
- All right."
714,3456236,3462554,"Label them clearly. They
will follow you later on."
715,3463868,3467101,Leave your luggage.

can't forget it."
996,5092024,5093748,It gives me a headache.
997,5100401,5103883,"- I couldn't get you out of here.

1004,5162212,5165236,Attention. Caps off.
1005,5174830,5177958,"- Work.
- Back to work."
1006,5191554,5196163,"- What are you making?
- Hinges, sir."
1007,5198436,5200274,"Yeah, I've got some
workers coming in"
1008,5200275,5202065,"tomorrow. Where are
they from again?"
1009,5202148,5204213,"Yugoslavia, Mr Commander."
1010,5204296,5206861,I've got to make room.
1011,5209322,5212784,"- Make me a hinge.
- Yes, sir."
1012,5244023,5247235,"Keep going, you're doing well."
1013,5247318,5249404,Says he's doing well.
1014,5256077,5258746,"Oh, that's very good."
1015,5258830,5262584,"But I'm a bit confused, and
perhaps you can help me."
1016,5262667,5266296,"What I don't understand is
that you've been working..."
1017,5266379,5270925,"since I think, what,
about 6.00 this morning?"
1018,5271468,5276097,Yet such a small pile of hinges.
1019,5305210,5308213,"- Oh, Christ.
- May I try that, sir?"
1020,5308296,5310465,"Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent."
1021,5310548,5313885,"No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever."
1022,5313968,5316450,"- Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
- Yeah, come on."
1023,5316533,5319703,What did I just say? Here.
1024,5322498,5323791,Mr Commander.
1025,5323832,5329380,"I beg to report that my heap of
hinges was so unsatisfactory..."
1026,5329463,5333488,"because the machines were being
recalibrated this morning."
1027,5335240,5338409,I was put on to shovelling coal.
1028,5362267,5364352,"Strange, huh?"
1029,5364435,5366396,Yeah.
1030,5371067,5374362,"Thank you, Muek."
1031,5374445,5378158,"Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the
leather, it's just been oiled."

- Oh, for me?"
1033,5380139,5382883,"Oh, thank you very
much, Mr Director."

1035,5383997,5386541,Mr Director.
1036,5389023,5391671,Mr Director.
1037,5393548,5394716,He was making hinges slowly.
1038,5394757,5397559,"So the man can turn
out a hinge in less"
1039,5397560,5400013,than a minute. Why the long story?
1040,5428771,5431836,"- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome."
1041,5435006,5437173,"Nobody knows who
stole the chicken?"
1042,5437174,5438885,Tell him about the chicken.
1043,5438968,5443765,"A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this."
1044,5443848,5446434,Save yourselves.
1045,5446518,5448937,Tell him about the chicken.
1046,5464536,5466704,Still nobody knows?
1047,5478320,5482137,"It was you. You
committed this crime."
1048,5482220,5484639,"- No, sir.
- But you know who, though."
1049,5484722,5486975,"- Yes.
- Who?"
1050,5487997,5490103,Him.
1051,5493565,5497485,"- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over."
1052,5500280,5504159,"Sir, thank you."
1053,5510290,5513084,"- Thank you again, Mr Director.
- You're welcome again."
1054,5513168,5515649,"It's an honour to work for
such a great company."
1055,5515650,5516693,It's great to have you.

- I only need five minutes."
1060,5538026,5540737,She wants to speak to Mr Director.
1061,5560256,5562467,Yes.
1062,5566721,5569495,He won't see you.
1063,5599587,5601756,"Please, sit down."
1064,5604843,5608075,"- Pernod? Cognac?
- No. No, thank you."
1065,5609013,5612559,"So, what can I do for you?"
1066,5616583,5619149,They say that no one dies here.
1067,5619232,5622798,They say your factory is a haven.

1080,5663985,5667426,I borrowed these clothes.
1081,5669574,5671659,I'm begging you.
1082,5671743,5675559,"Please, please bring them here."

I ask one thing:"

has certain skills."
1086,5685632,5688134,"My father is an importer,

1087,5688176,5692722,"Such activities are illegal.

1101,5744220,5747548,"It's dangerous. It's
dangerous to me."
1102,5750384,5754075,"You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure."
1103,5754159,5757412,"You have to think of
it in his situation."
1104,5757808,5760415,He's got this whole place to run.
1105,5760498,5763209,"He's responsible for everything

1106,5763293,5766629,"He's got a lot of
things to worry about."
1107,5766817,5770675,"And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people."
1108,5770758,5774262,"Never the good, always
the bad. Always the bad."
1109,5776514,5779027,"But in normal
circumstances he wouldn't"
1110,5779028,5781102,be like this. He'd be all right.
1111,5781186,5784647,"There'd just be the good

1701,9173086,9175169,Faster. Quick. Quick.
1702,9175252,9177501,What's going on back there?
1703,9180083,9181999,Move it.
1704,9186789,9190662,"Come on, out. Hurry up, out."
1705,9190704,9196952,"Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five..."
1706,9197034,9198951,Out.
1707,9199034,9201450,Get out.
1708,9201533,9204449,"Quicker, get out."
1709,9208156,9210800,"All of you, out."
1710,9211717,9215465,"- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?"
1711,9218381,9220026,Move the line.
1712,9220525,9222524,Get out.
1713,9227273,9230646,"- Quick. Get out.
- Faster."
1714,9233229,9235269,Quicker.
1715,9235311,9237685,"Come on, be quick."
1716,9237727,9241225,"Mama, where are we?"
1717,9242329,9245516,"- 17, 18, 20...
- They're in Auschwitz."
1718,9245599,9249556,"The train was never routed
here. A paperwork mistake."
1719,9257885,9260301,Take off your shoes.
1720,9273213,9276129,"Quicker, quicker."
1721,9279523,9281043,Take off your clothes. Hurry up.
1722,9281126,9283792,"Hurry up. Stay in a row and
take off your clothes."
1723,9285333,9287040,Quicker.
1724,9301784,9304741,Quicker.
1725,9304825,9308074,"Take off your clothes
quickly. Hurry up."
1726,9315237,9317175,"Go in, hurry up."
1727,9320153,9321652,Quicker.
1728,9321736,9324526,"Go to the showers, quickly."
1729,9326608,9330814,Quicker. Quicker.
1730,9480797,9482670,Eyes on the necks.
1731,9485377,9488169,Hands on the shoulders.
1732,9488210,9491417,"- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight."
1733,9491458,9494208,"Cough for me, mother."
1734,9494209,9496957,"They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness."
1735,9497249,9499747,"Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara."
1736,9499830,9503704,"If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you."
1737,9505557,9508077,"- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir."
1738,9508161,9510368,"- Sir?
- Good morning."
1739,9510451,9513409,"A mistake has been made. We
are not supposed to be here."
1740,9513492,9517240,"We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews."
1741,9517324,9520780,"- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow."
1742,9520864,9525237,"- Enamelware.
- A pot maker."
1743,9525736,9527902,"How old are you, mother?"
1744,9532109,9537919,"You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour..."
1745,9538107,9540398,Mr Schindler.
1746,9540480,9543355,"I remember earlier this
year, IG Farben ordered..."
1747,9543437,9549228,"a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory."
1748,9549311,9553225,"The train came in
through the archway..."
1749,9553309,9555842,and the officer in charge of the
1750,9555843,9558932,"selection went
immediately to work..."
1751,9559015,9561722,"and sent 2,000 of them..."
1752,9561764,9565346,"straight away to
""special treatment""."
1753,9566054,9568952,"It is not my task to
interfere with the"
1754,9568953,9571635,"processes that take
place down here."
1755,9572780,9577882,"Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?"
1756,9577966,9581277,Allow me to express the reason.
1757,9589711,9593210,"I'm not making any
judgement about you."
1758,9593251,9595792,"It's just that I know that
in the coming months..."
1759,9595834,9599624,"we're all going to
need portable wealth."
1760,9602268,9604976,I could have you arrested.
1761,9605060,9610328,"I'm protected by powerful
friends. You should know that."
1762,9612702,9616617,I do not say I am accepting them.
1763,9616700,9621990,"All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table."
1764,9635547,9638733,"I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow."
1765,9638816,9641190,I'll cut you 300 units from it.
1766,9641274,9645231,New ones. These are fresh.
1767,9648938,9651713,"The train comes,
we turn it around."
1768,9651714,9652956,"Yes, yes, yes."
1769,9653040,9654560,"- It's yours.
- I understand."
1770,9654956,9657726,I want these.
1771,9660245,9663910,You shouldn't get stuck on names.
1772,9670637,9674886,"That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork."
1773,9674969,9678967,"Zoldinger, Ernestina.
Waldergrun, Hilda."
1774,9679050,9681258,"Waldergrun, Leonora."
1775,9681341,9684714,"Laast, Anna. Pfefferberg, Mila."
1776,9684798,9688339,"Dresner, Ruth. Dresner, Danka."
1777,9688422,9692129,"Nussbaum, Sidonia. Rosner, Manci."
1778,9692211,9698209,"Hirsch, Helen. Grosz, Chaja
Sara. Seelenfreund, Estella."
1779,9713036,9715203,"Move it. Move it, quick."
1780,9715285,9719825,"- Faster. Faster.
- Come on."
1781,9721492,9724365,"Quick, quick. Faster."
1782,9726240,9730321,"- Faster.
- Hurry up."
1783,9738610,9741692,No. No. No.
1784,9756020,9759768,No. No. No.
1785,9763434,9765724,No. No. No.
1786,9767807,9771763,Hey. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?
1787,9771846,9773895,These are mine. These are my
1788,9773896,9776678,"workers. They should
be on my train."
1789,9776761,9779385,"They're skilled munitions
workers. They're essential."
1790,9780093,9782676,Essential girls.
1791,9784841,9789235,"Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings."
1792,9789319,9792713,"How else am I to polish the inside
of a 45 millimetre shell casing?"
1793,9792796,9796628,You tell me. You tell me.
1794,9798065,9802231,"Back on the train.
Back on the train."
1795,9916351,9920578,"Under Department ""W"" provisions..."
1796,9920662,9925035,"it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause."
1797,9925118,9928117,"Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund..."
1798,9928200,9932490,"I am entitled to file damage
claims for such deaths."
1799,9932573,9935531,If you shoot without thinking...
1800,9935614,9939904,"you go to prison, I get paid."
1801,9939987,9942278,That's how it works.
1802,9942361,9947526,"So, there will be no
summary executions here."
1803,9948317,9953066,"There will be no interference
of any kind with production."
1804,9953149,9955720,"In hopes of ensuring
that, guards will no"
1805,9955721,9958293,"longer be allowed on
the factory floor..."
1806,9958376,9962042,without my authorisation.
1807,9966810,9971558,"For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude."
1808,9972204,9974349,"Come on, come."
1809,9974952,9977035,"Oh, boy. I haven't seen something
like that since years."
1810,9977118,9979972,"Come on, boys, come."
1811,10005628,10011563,"No doorman or maitre d' will
ever mistake you again..."
1812,10011646,10014000,I promise.
1813,10020664,10022825,"This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant."
1814,10022826,10024433,You must be Mrs Schindler.
1815,10024475,10025797,It's a pleasure to meet you.
1816,10025798,10027332,"Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic."
1817,10027334,10029118,"- Very generous of you.
- I know."
1818,10029160,10031826,"We need to talk when
you have a moment."
1819,10031909,10034491,"This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse."
1820,10034574,10037577,"Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive."
1821,10037578,10038578,"- Madam.
- Hello."
1822,10038635,10039635,What is it?
1823,10039636,10042363,"We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board."
1824,10042447,10044613,"The artillery shells, tank
shells, rocket casings."
1825,10044696,10047361,"Apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests."
1826,10047362,10048404,That's to be expected.
1827,10048485,10050198,"Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and"
1828,10050199,10051693,pans. This is a precise business.
1829,10051776,10053733,"- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment."
1830,10053775,10055810,"Sure, so would I, so
would you. I wouldn't"
1831,10055811,10057941,"worry. We'll get it right
one of these days."
1832,10057982,10060115,There's a rumour you've been going
1833,10060116,10062439,"around miscalibrating
the machines."
1834,10062480,10067228,"They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz."
1835,10067953,10070319,"I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells."
1836,10070320,10072414,"- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference..."
1837,10072415,10074036,"whether they're made
here or somewhere else."
1838,10074038,10075572,"You don't see a difference?
I see a difference."
1839,10075574,10076808,You'll lose a lot of money.
1840,10076891,10080182,"Fewer shells will be made. Stern,
if this factory ever produces..."
1841,10080265,10085637,"a shell that can actually be
fired, I'll be very unhappy."
1842,10085720,10088761,"- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?"
1843,10102172,10106712,"How are you doing, Rabbi? Rabbi."
1844,10108878,10111628,"Good, Mr Director."
1845,10112793,10115042,Sun's going down.
1846,10117292,10119395,"Yes, it is."
1847,10120623,10124705,"What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?"
1848,10124789,10126767,Is it?
1849,10130203,10132447,What's the matter with you? You
1850,10132448,10135201,"should be preparing
for the Sabbath."
1851,10135285,10138137,Shouldn't you?
1852,10144156,10149258,"I've got some wine.
In my office. Come."
1853,10223791,10226873,What?
1854,10226955,10231871,"Do you have any money,
hidden away some place..."
1855,10231954,10235119,that I don't know about?
1856,10238077,10240575,No.
1857,10244886,10248905,Why? Am I broke?
1858,10251883,10254028,Well...
1859,10254945,10261317,"Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m..."
1860,10261400,10265357,"at General Eisenhower's
headquarters..."
1861,10265441,10268148,General Jodl...
1862,10268231,10272333,"signed the Act of
Unconditional Surrender..."
1863,10272416,10278435,"of all German land, sea and
air forces in Europe..."
1864,10278518,10282601,to the Allied Expeditionary Force.
1865,10282642,10286807,"And simultaneously to the
Soviet High Command."
1866,10287515,10291305,"The German war is,
therefore, at an end."
1867,10291389,10293387,"But let us not forget
for a moment..."
1868,10293429,10297719,"I think it's time the guards
came into the factory."
1869,10297802,10300968,"Japan, with all her
treachery and greed..."
1870,10301551,10307049,"The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced."
1871,10307132,10311776,"At midnight tonight,
the war is over."
1872,10313672,10316045,"Tomorrow you'll begin
the process..."
1873,10316128,10319856,"of looking for survivors
of your families."
1874,10322293,10327770,"In most cases, you
won't find them."
1875,10328936,10331747,After six long years of murder...
1876,10331872,10337204,"victims are being mourned
throughout the world."
1877,10337287,10340411,We've survived.
1878,10340453,10344701,"Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me."
1879,10346700,10348865,Thank yourselves.
1880,10349990,10353364,Thank your fearless Stern...
1881,10353405,10355780,"and others among you who
worried about you..."
1882,10355821,10359861,and faced death at every moment.
1883,10362798,10365442,I'm a member of the Nazi party.
1884,10365567,10368836,I'm a munitions manufacturer.
1885,10368920,10371315,I'm a profiteer of slave labour.
1886,10371398,10375105,I am a criminal.
1887,10375189,10380207,"At midnight you'll be
free, and I'll be hunted."
1888,10380811,10384310,"I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight..."
1889,10384393,10386486,"after which time,"
1890,10386487,10390661,"and I hope you'll forgive
me I have to flee."
1891,10392785,10396513,"I know you have received
orders from our commandant..."
1892,10396596,10399076,"which he has received
from his superiors"
1893,10399077,10401678,"to dispose of the
population of this camp."
1894,10401761,10404135,Now would be the time to do it.
1895,10404219,10410195,"Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity."
1896,10414297,10418004,Or you could leave...
1897,10418088,10420399,"and return to your
families as men..."
1898,10420483,10424377,instead of murderers.
1899,10464507,10468672,"In memory of the countless
victims among your people..."
1900,10468755,10472940,"I ask us to observe three
minutes of silence."
1901,10527544,10532750,"- Thank you, Mr Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr Jereth."
1902,10532834,10535208,Open wide.
1903,10536873,10538977,"Thank you, Mr Jereth."
1904,10557491,10559781,"Thank you, Mr Jereth."
1905,10583771,10588083,"As soon as peace occurs, I want..."
1906,10588166,10592289,"I want that cloth
distributed to the workers."
1907,10592325,10594912,Two and a half metres each.
1908,10594996,10598182,"Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka."
1909,10598266,10601285,"They won't drink it.
They know its value."
1910,10601369,10604846,"Likewise those Egipshi
cigarettes we organised."
1911,10604930,10609157,It'll be done. Everything you ask.
1912,10628254,10632523,"We've written a letter,
trying to explain things..."
1913,10632606,10635772,in case you are captured.
1914,10637084,10640269,Every worker has signed it.
1915,10650307,10652223,Thank you.
1916,10679004,10681315,"It is Hebrew, from the Talmud."
1917,10681399,10687459,"It says: ""Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire."""
1918,10726319,10729796,I could have got more out.
1919,10730984,10733482,"I could have got
more. I don't know."
1920,10734086,10735877,If I just...
1921,10737001,10738106,I could have got more.
1922,10738189,10741000,"Oskar, there are
1,100 people who are"
1923,10741001,10743665,"alive because of
you. Look at them."
1924,10744062,10746540,If I'd made more money...
1925,10750538,10755370,I threw away so much money.
1926,10757327,10760347,You have no idea.
1927,10760430,10761430,If I had just...
1928,10762491,10766699,"There will be generations
because of what you did."
1929,10767927,10770301,I didn't do enough.
1930,10770385,10773321,You did so much.
