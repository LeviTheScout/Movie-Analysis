to find him..."
287,2163877,2167717,"and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there."
288,2167843,2168809,"Yes, sir."
289,2181761,2184619,"We expected 32 tanks,
27 didn't make it."
290,2184744,2188090,"- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go in, Captain."
291,2188215,2191395,"lf we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,"
292,2191520,2194091,"we'll have an entire division
stuck at Carentan"

around its ankles."
294,2196253,2198165,"Well, you let me know."
295,2198291,2201924,"Have Charlie Company hold
Vierville until we get there."
296,2202050,2204216,"Yes, sir. Runner!"
297,2209531,2213068,"Airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us."
298,2213192,2215977,"They misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind."
299,2216101,2217142,What's your situation?
300,2217265,2219719,"Yes, sir. Sector four is secure."
301,2221896,2224064,We took out towed 88s
302,2224189,2226901,"here, here...and here."
303,2227026,2228663,"They'd already gotten
four Shermans"
304,2228790,2230757,and some deuce-and-a-halves.
305,2230881,2233165,"These two minefields
are one big one."
306,2233289,2234660,"We tried going through,"
307,2234785,2237737,"but it turned
into a high-density field..."
308,2237863,2239151,little bit of everything.
309,2239275,2241952,"Spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, A-200s..."
310,2242078,2246159,"the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up."
311,2246285,2250146,"This road here...
they placed Teller mine 43s,"
312,2250270,2251978,l guess for our tanks...
313,2252101,2255091,"from here
to the edge of the village."
314,2255213,2257793,"So we marked 'em,
called the engineers."
315,2257917,2259165,Resistance?
316,2259289,2261125,"We had higher
support expectations, sir."
317,2261251,2263760,"There was an understrength
company without artillery."
318,2263884,2267013,"Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
von Luck Kampfgruppe."
319,2267139,2269153,We ended up with 23 prisoners.
320,2269277,2271408,We turned them over to MPs.
321,2275270,2277183,What about our casualties?
322,2278264,2279387,Well...
323,2279510,2281139,the figures...
324,2281265,2283732,were 35 dead...
325,2283855,2285104,times two wounded.
326,2285229,2290196,"They just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s."
327,2290320,2293146,"lt was tough,
that's why you got it."
328,2293269,2294766,"Yes, sir."
329,2296055,2297137,John...
330,2300171,2302391,l've got another one for you.
331,2302518,2305555,"- Yes, sir.
- Straight from the top."
332,2311916,2316152,"We're taking a squad to Neuville
on a public relations mission."
333,2316277,2318189,You leading a squad?
334,2318314,2323157,"Some Private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home."
335,2323282,2324529,How come Neuville?
336,2324655,2328168,"They think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops."
337,2328294,2332054,"lt won't be easy finding one
particular soldier."
338,2332179,2334834,"Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles."
339,2334919,2336332,What about the company?
340,2336457,2340117,"We take our pick,
the rest get folded into Baker."
341,2340240,2341790,Jesus Christ.
342,2341917,2344170,They took away your company?
343,2344294,2348390,"lt wasn't my company. lt was
the army's. So they told me."
344,2348517,2352151,"Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo."
345,2352276,2353952,Beasley's dead.
346,2354074,2357234,"All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?"
347,2357360,2359771,Not that l know of.
348,2359896,2361107,What about Talbot?
349,2361233,2363535,"- This morning.
- Oh. All right."
350,2363657,2366156,"l'll try to dig up
another interpreter."
351,2366281,2368337,"Assemble
at battalion motor pool."
352,2368463,2369385,"Yes, sir."
353,2369510,2371764,"- What we doing?
- Listen up... What?"
354,2371891,2373134,What we gonna do?
355,2373257,2376958,"You're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, Caparzo."
356,2377082,2379785,You like it in the ass.
357,2379908,2381748,Attention!
358,2381875,2383172,As you were.
359,2383298,2384962,"l'm looking for Corporal Upham,"
360,2385087,2387218,"- Timothy E.
- l'm Upham, sir."
361,2387346,2389902,"- You speak French and German?
- Yes, sir."
362,2390028,2390947,Accent?
363,2391072,2393916,"A slight one in French.
My German's clean, sir."
364,2394043,2396579,"You're reassigned to me.
Grab your gear."
365,2396704,2399530,"We're going to Neuville.
When was this updated?"
366,2399655,2401451,"As of 0830, sir."
367,2401578,2402998,"Uh, sir..."
368,2403125,2404749,These two axes advance south...
369,2404874,2406753,"Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville."
370,2406879,2412355,"- Yes, Corporal.
- Sir, a LOT of Germans."
371,2412480,2413931,"You have a problem
with that, Corporal?"
372,2414057,2418297,"No, l've never been in combat.
l make maps, translate..."
373,2418420,2421298,"l need someone who speaks
French and German."
374,2421422,2422636,My guys were killed.
375,2422760,2425636,"But l haven't held a weapon
since training, sir."
376,2425761,2429073,"- Did you fire the weapon?
- Yes, sir."
377,2429198,2431663,"- Then get your gear.
- Yes, sir."
378,2433404,2434984,"Sir, may l..."
379,2439726,2442064,"May l bring my typewriter, sir?"
380,2446485,2447493,"Yes, sir."
381,2451219,2453667,"Thank you very much, sir."
382,2453793,2456247,"- That a souvenir?
- No, sir."
383,2456370,2457950,"Take your time, Corporal."
384,2461493,2464041,"Look on the bright side,
Corporal."
385,2464165,2465288,"Yes, sir."
386,2465412,2469309,"For one thing...
you don't need to carry those."
387,2469434,2470737,You'll need that.
388,2470860,2473641,"Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that..."
389,2532749,2534577,You want your head blown off?
390,2534703,2537612,"Don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws."
391,2537737,2539942,Get the fuck back in formation.
392,2541148,2543828,"l was wondering
where you're from, that's..."
393,2549135,2550646,"Caparzo, is it?"
394,2550770,2552225,"Hey, drop dead, Corporal."
395,2552350,2553426,Got you.
396,2553552,2558016,"And saluting the captain
makes him a target for Germans."
397,2558142,2561472,"So don't do it, especially
when l'm next to him."
398,2563730,2565230,"Corporal, what's
your book about?"
399,2565357,2567867,"- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry."
400,2567992,2570590,"lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood"
401,2570717,2572628,"that develop between
soldiers during war."
402,2572752,2574706,Brotherhood?
403,2574828,2576574,"What do you know
about brotherhood?"
404,2576700,2579152,"Get a load of this guy, Fish."
405,2579278,2581486,Ask the captain where he's from.
406,2581612,2583032,"Yeah, ask the captain."
407,2583157,2585120,"He'll tell you everything
you wanna know."
408,2585243,2588006,"You wanna explain
the math of this to me?"
409,2588132,2592641,"Why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?"
410,2592766,2595424,"20 degrees.
Anybody wanna answer?"
411,2595508,2599125,"Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother."
412,2599249,2600997,"l got a mother, all right?"
413,2601124,2603613,"l mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother."
414,2603739,2606910,"Shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother."
415,2607037,2610056,"Well, not the captain,
but the rest of us."
416,2610181,2613549,"''Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die.''"
417,2616127,2619203,"What does that mean?
We're all supposed to die?"
418,2619328,2622206,"Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers."
419,2622332,2623585,"Yes, sir."
420,2623710,2626255,"We have orders to follow.
That supersedes everything,"
421,2626381,2627722,including your mothers.
422,2627847,2629104,"Thank you, sir."
423,2629229,2631614,"Even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?"
424,2631739,2634393,"Especially if you think
the mission's fubar."
425,2634476,2635931,What's ''fubar''?
426,2636057,2638718,"Oh, it's German. Yeah."
427,2638843,2641047,Never heard of that.
428,2641173,2642596,Sir...
429,2642720,2644976,"l have an opinion
on this matter."
430,2645100,2648029,"Well, by all means,
share it with the squad."
431,2648155,2650250,"Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,"
432,2650375,2653037,"this entire mission is
a serious misallocation"
433,2653162,2655031,of valuable military resources.
434,2655156,2656819,Yeah. Go on.
435,2656945,2658982,"Well, it seems to me, sir,"
436,2659106,2662443,"that God made me
a fine instrument of warfare."
437,2663528,2666575,"Reiben, pay attention.
This is the way to gripe!"
438,2666701,2667622,"Continue, Jackson."
439,2667749,2669007,"What l mean, sir,"
440,2669131,2674130,"if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of Adolf Hitler"
441,2674255,2676624,"with a clear line
of sight, sir..."
442,2676750,2680076,"Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen."
443,2680200,2681620,"Oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin."
444,2681746,2685004,"So, Captain, what about you?
You don't gripe at all?"
445,2685128,2688013,"l don't gripe to you,
Reiben. l'm a captain."
446,2688139,2691280,"There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down."
447,2691403,2696097,"You gripe to me, l gripe
to my superiors and so on."
448,2696222,2700048,"l don't gripe to you
or in front of you."
449,2700172,2702010,"l'm sorry, sir, but, uh..."
450,2702136,2706627,"Let's say you weren't a captain.
What would you say then?"
451,2706752,2708051,"Well, in that case,"
452,2708177,2711025,"l'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,"
453,2711151,2713016,"with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,"
454,2713143,2715635,"worthy of
my best efforts, sir."
455,2715763,2718212,"Moreover...l feel
heartfelt sorrow"
456,2718338,2720998,"for the mother
of Private James Ryan"
457,2721128,2725385,"and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,"
458,2725509,2728570,"especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering."
459,2729697,2732160,"- He's good.
- l love him."
460,2742516,2743604,Right.
461,2785527,2787200,Thunder!
462,2787326,2788624,Flash!
463,2788752,2790007,"Upham, over there."
464,2790135,2792094,"Reiben, you four go."
465,2801741,2803326,"Go, go, go, go, go."
466,2808764,2810421,You're a welcome sight.
467,2810547,2812006,Our relief showed up.
468,2812129,2813623,How many are you?
469,2813747,2816118,"Just eight. We're not
your relief. Sorry."
470,2816242,2817989,"What do you mean, sir?"
471,2818114,2820026,We're here for a Private Ryan.
472,2820151,2821819,Who? Ryan? What for?
473,2821944,2824327,"- ls he here?
- l don't know."
474,2824452,2830393,"Maybe on the other side of town.
The Germans cut us in two."
475,2830518,2834218,"- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan."
476,2834345,2835632,He dropped in with 101st.
477,2835757,2838419,"- Goldman, get me a runner.
- Runner!"
478,2838543,2839832,Come on.
479,2844130,2846050,"Jonesy, make a hole there!"
480,2847600,2851034,"We got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward."
481,2851160,2853983,"The Germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day."
482,2854108,2856477,"lt's been quiet
for about 45 minutes."
483,2856603,2859971,"Most of the German fire
is concentrated to the westward."
484,2860095,2861595,Who's on the loudspeaker?
485,2861719,2863015,"That's Dagwood Düsseldorf,"
486,2863140,2865814,"our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer."
487,2865898,2867990,The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.
488,2868117,2871630,"''The Statue of Liberty
is kaputt.''"
489,2871757,2873248,That's disconcerting.
490,2876534,2877988,Take the second left...
491,2878113,2881986,"Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!"
492,2882109,2884994,"Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with 101 ."
493,2885119,2887000,"- Got that?
- Cover!"
494,2894509,2895840,Go!
495,2919536,2921282,Those sadistic fuckin' animals!
496,2921407,2922326,Get down.
497,2922453,2925586,"They know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners."
498,2925711,2927175,Why keep shooting him?
499,2927303,2930024,"Long as he lives,
he carries the message."
500,2930150,2932608,"- We'd do the same.
- We wouldn't!"
501,2932733,2936265,"- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir."
502,2936390,2939631,"Try again to let Captain Hamill
know we're coming."
503,2939757,2941003,"What's the rest
of Neuville like?"
504,2941131,2944975,"Uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides."
505,2945099,2948363,"A lotta windows
and a square on the left."
506,2948488,2950917,"- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here."
507,2951043,2952042,"Yes, sir."
508,2956127,2959578,"Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings."
509,2959703,2962620,"Try a left hook.
Two of yours, two of mine."
510,2962745,2964753,"Hastings, Goldman, up front!"
511,2966133,2967430,"Reiben, Caparzo."
512,2967555,2969355,Fundamentals. Short runs.
513,2969481,2971863,High and low at the corners.
514,2971990,2974229,Be prepared for close contact.
515,2974354,2977596,"Go. Upham,
stay with Sergeant Horvath."

520,2993328,2994284,Good.
521,3002147,3003776,"Reiben,

527,3023771,3025903,"Somebody must know
where he's from."
528,3026028,3029418,"Been with him since Kasserine
Pass, and l don't know."
529,3029545,3031052,My ankles are killing me.
530,3031179,3034002,"l'll need a wheelchair
before this is over."
531,3034128,3036622,"Ow! That's it. Oh, my God."
532,3036747,3038618,Got ankles like an old woman.
533,3038743,3039989,Like an old...
534,3043157,3044410,Reiben.
535,3044536,3046629,"So you don't even know
where he went to school?"
536,3046756,3048638,"Captain didn't go to school,"
537,3048765,3051567,"they assembled him
out of Gl body parts."
538,3051692,3053018,Pay attention to detail.
539,3053144,3056593,"l know where he's from 'cause
l pay attention to detail."
540,3056718,3058006,"Hey, Upham..."
541,3058131,3060710,"careful you don't step
in the bullshit."
542,3065932,3066978,Do it.
543,3067102,3068023,Thunder!
544,3068147,3070618,"Thunder, or we will fire on you!"
545,3080892,3082977,"Upham, tell them
to show themselves."
546,3095954,3098784,Ask where the Germans are.
547,3103113,3104577,What's he saying?
548,3104702,3105959,The children.
549,3106084,3107130,Take the children.
550,3107256,3109726,"No, we can't take the kids."
551,3111107,3113807,We can't take the kids! No!
552,3116096,3118963,"They think
they'll be safe with us."
553,3119089,3121751,lt's not gonna be safe with us!
554,3121875,3124572,"Are you nuts?!
Listen to the Captain!"
555,3124698,3127084,"They think
they'll be safe, sir."
556,3127210,3129050,Not gonna be safe anywhere.
557,3130851,3132018,Put that kid back!
558,3135175,3137421,Put that little girl back!
559,3137545,3139582,"Caparzo,

560,3139706,3142412,"Upham, how do you say
''lt's OK''?"
561,3142540,3144627,"She reminds me of my niece, sir."
562,3144753,3146596,Get the kid back up there!
563,3146722,3150530,"Captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town."
564,3150655,3152032,"We're not here
to do the decent thing!"
565,3152156,3153734,"We're here to follow
fuckin' orders!"
566,3153859,3155815,"Sarge, take this goddamn kid!"
567,3157200,3159945,Cover! Cover!
568,3167378,3168678,Come on. No!
569,3168801,3170728,"Goddamit!
Where'd that come from?"
570,3173141,3175468,"He was on the ground
before we heard."
571,3181497,3182830,That's where l'd be.
572,3185131,3186389,l didn't see it.
573,3186514,3189025,"450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under."
574,3189150,3191034,"l wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!"
575,3191159,3193487,This sniper's got talent!
576,3198059,3201595,"Please don't cry. l'll take you
back to your parents."
577,3201718,3203639,Please don't cry. Come on.
578,3219529,3220443,Captain.
579,3220569,3222818,"Hold on, Caparzo."
580,3222940,3223987,Help me up.
581,3224111,3225745,l can walk. l can walk.
582,3225872,3227568,"Caparzo, stay still!"
583,3235532,3236863,All right.
584,3239150,3241852,"Two clicks, left wind."
585,3254174,3257293,"Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?"
586,3257418,3259579,"Wade, you stay put."
587,3259704,3261076,"Where's he shot, Captain?"
588,3263241,3266047,"- Can you see him?
- Stay there!"
589,3266176,3268602,"Damn it, stay down!"
590,3268726,3270023,What's up with you?
591,3270147,3273442,What if you get hit? Huh?
592,3273564,3275479,"Fish, come over here."
593,3275601,3277388,"Carpy, put your head down."
594,3277516,3279218,Put your head down.
595,3287777,3290789,"O my God, l trust in Thee."
596,3290916,3293827,Let me not be ashamed.
597,3293950,3296946,"Let not my enemies
triumph over me."
598,3306159,3308001,Copy it.
599,3308126,3310469,Copy it and send it for me.
600,3310594,3312968,"You're gonna send it.
Put it down!"
601,3313092,3315379,"- lt's got blood!

605,3354680,3355679,Stay down.
606,3363725,3365567,How bad is it?
607,3365694,3367957,"Chest, maybe lung shot."

611,3394144,3395681,Clear down!
612,3410367,3412496,"That's why
we can't take children."
613,3419103,3422597,"Sergeant Horvath,

614,3422723,3425398,Upham... canteens.
615,3425523,3426743,Fill 'em up.
616,3426867,3429043,"- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir."
617,3429168,3433505,"Gather your men. We'll form up
at the north-west corner."
618,3435813,3438559,"Mellish, check the tower."
619,3438683,3440055,Right now. Go!
620,3451964,3453293,Fuck Ryan.
621,3464152,3466625,"- Thunder!

622,3466750,3468049,Come on in.
623,3473140,3475218,"Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill."
624,3475342,3477047,Somewhere across the square.
625,3477171,3478628,Across the square.
626,3478751,3480996,Go easy. Watch for snipers.
627,3481123,3483076,Take it easy. Sit down.
628,3499515,3502634,"Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here."
629,3502758,3503968,What? Up there?
630,3504096,3507030,"How should l know?
Would you go look, please?"
631,3507154,3508453,"Thank you, you moron."
632,3510333,3512047,All right.
633,3512174,3515743,"You guys just flake out
here for a while."
634,3517324,3520069,"Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot."
635,3528800,3530222,Jesus!
636,3530347,3532436,Drop your weapons!
637,3532559,3533639,Drop 'em now!

647,3588546,3590177,Enough to make you old.
648,3591389,3592722,Let's hope so.
649,3602616,3603991,"Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st."
650,3604119,3606003,"John Miller, 2nd Rangers."
651,3606130,3608141,Thank you.
652,3608267,3610483,"We're looking for
Private James Ryan."
653,3610609,3614358,"He's part of your outfit.
Any chance you policed him up?"
654,3614481,3617639,"- How was the road in?
- Scenic."
655,3617764,3619719,We lost most of our ammo.
656,3619842,3621964,And one of our men.
657,3622088,3625386,"Lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side."
658,3625514,3626608,"Yes, sir!"
659,3626731,3628616,And get Ryan up here.
660,3630162,3631585,Ryan!
661,3631708,3633994,"Ryan, front and centre!"
662,3634119,3635740,Ryan!
663,3639151,3640565,Here comes our boy.
664,3647983,3650074,Told you he was an asshole.
665,3652453,3654031,"Sir, Private Ryan reporting."
666,3654156,3655611,At ease.
667,3655736,3659187,"Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you."
668,3660933,3663011,This way.
669,3663137,3664600,All right.
670,3664725,3666067,Take a knee.
671,3675209,3677870,"Private, l have some bad news."
672,3686249,3690352,"Well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh..."
673,3692232,3696013,"so l'll just say it -
your brothers are dead."
674,3696138,3701833,"We have, uh, orders
to come get you..."
675,3701957,3703413,'cause you're going home.
676,3717896,3720351,"Oh, my God.
My brothers are dead."
677,3726361,3730463,"l was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home."
678,3745702,3747174,"l'm so sorry, James."
679,3747301,3749747,l can't tell you how much.
680,3749872,3752628,How...how did they die?
681,3752754,3755579,They were killed in action.
682,3755703,3759794,"No, that can't be.
They're both..."
683,3759919,3761996,That...that can't be.
684,3762120,3766051,"My brothers are still
in grammar school."
685,3767729,3769734,You're James Ryan?
686,3769860,3771491,Yeah.
687,3771616,3774777,James Francis Ryan from lowa?
688,3774902,3777644,"James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota."
689,3783340,3786693,"Well, does that...does that
mean my brothers are OK?"
690,3786820,3788622,"Yeah, l'm sure they're fine."
691,3788748,3790670,"Are you sure they're OK,
though?"
692,3790796,3793709,"We're looking for
a different Private Ryan."
693,3793833,3795580,How do you know?
694,3795704,3797826,How do you know the foul-up
695,3797951,3800445,"isn't that his brothers
are OK and that..."
696,3800570,3802731,"Lieutenant,
l'm sorry for the trouble."
697,3802854,3807672,"l just wrote them a letter...
l got to get home."
698,3807796,3811436,l got to get home right now.
699,3811559,3813143,"Shh, take it easy."
700,3813266,3815553,"- Where's our Ryan?
- l don't know."
701,3815676,3817300,You in touch with your CO?
702,3817423,3820084,"- That figures.
- What unit's he in?"
703,3820208,3821664,"Baker Company, 506."
704,3821787,3824958,"- The guy with the broken foot?
- Charlie, l think."
705,3825083,3826257,You think? Yeah.
706,3826385,3829109,Ryan? Don't know... Man!
707,3829234,3831366,Where was your drop zone?
708,3831491,3832824,Just inside of Vierville.
709,3832950,3835815,"Vierville?
How did you end up here?"
710,3835940,3837024,"You got me, sir."
711,3837148,3838976,C-47 took heavy fire.
712,3839102,3842051,"Pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way."
713,3842174,3846145,"Took more fire in the drop.
Got messy. l ended up here."
714,3846271,3849623,"l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir."
715,3849748,3853318,"Anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?"
716,3853442,3856977,"No, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us."
717,3857102,3858929,Show me.
718,3859055,3860551,My men are beat.
719,3860675,3864672,"We'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark."
720,3864797,3868699,"Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?"
721,3868823,3871624,"Something with clean sheets
and room service?"
722,3871749,3873621,How about a nice comfy church?
723,3873746,3876032,"- We'll take that.
- Any news?"
724,3876157,3877612,How's it all falling together?
725,3877736,3879567,"Well, we got
the beachhead secure."
726,3879691,3882393,"Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen."
727,3882516,3885022,"We can't pull out
till he's ready, so..."
728,3885147,3886111,That guy's overrated.
729,3886239,3887499,No argument here.
730,3887624,3890342,"You got to take Caen
so you can take Saint-Lo."
731,3890468,3892429,Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.
732,3892554,3894049,"Valognes, you got Cherbourg."
733,3894175,3895588,"And Cherbourg, you got Paris."
734,3895712,3897999,"Paris, you get Berlin."
735,3898124,3900079,Then that big boat home.
736,3902238,3905160,"We sure could
use you around here,"
737,3905288,3907052,"but l understand
what you're doing."
738,3907178,3908306,You do?
739,3908433,3911651,"Yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself."
740,3911775,3914062,"- Oh.
- Good luck."
741,3914187,3915273,Thank you.
742,3915396,3917018,"No, l mean it."
743,3917144,3919636,Find him. Get him home.
744,3927861,3930117,What's with your hand?
745,3930242,3932496,l don't know.
746,3934160,3937903,"lt started when they brought
us down for embarkation."
747,3938027,3939444,lt comes and goes.
748,3939568,3942722,"You may have to get
yourself a new job."
749,3942846,3946026,"This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more."
750,3951306,3952427,What?
751,3956294,3958495,"- What?
- Nothing."
752,3958619,3961493,"What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?"
753,3961616,3964569,"He was always walking around
on his hands,"
754,3964694,3968596,"and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?"
755,3977096,3978426,"Yeah, Vecchio."
756,3978551,3980879,He was a goofy kid.
757,3981004,3985171,"Remember he used to pee
a ''V'' on everybody's jacket,"
758,3985297,3987357,for Vecchio.
759,3987481,3988736,For victory.
760,3988861,3990157,Vecchio.
761,3993037,3994365,He was so short.
762,3994489,3998315,"- Wasn't he a midget?
- How did he become a Ranger?"
763,4000977,4003179,Got shot in the foot once.
764,4003306,4005689,"He could walk faster
on his hands."
765,4007747,4010336,"He could run faster
on his hands than..."
766,4026120,4032641,"You see, when...you end up
killing one of your men,"
767,4032768,4035813,you tell yourself it happened
768,4035936,4042991,"so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others."
769,4043118,4045038,Maybe a hundred others.
770,4048277,4052329,"Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?"
771,4052450,4055709,"- How many?
- 94."
772,4055831,4059436,"But that means
l've saved the lives"
773,4059568,4061800,"of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?"
774,4061923,4064863,"Maybe even 20, right?"
775,4064986,4066343,20 times as many?
776,4072164,4074365,And that's how simple it is.
777,4075430,4077597,That's how you...
778,4077745,4080844,"That's how you rationalise
making the choice"
779,4080966,4084101,between the mission and the men.
780,4084225,4087144,"Except this time,
this mission is a man."
781,4090629,4093041,This Ryan better be worth it.
782,4096134,4098988,"He'd better go home
and cure some disease"
783,4099110,4102976,"or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something."
784,4103098,4107954,"l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo."
785,4108106,4109876,Amen.
786,4111057,4114137,Look. There it goes again.
787,4114278,4115544,Sir...
788,4115666,4118556,are you all right?
789,4123075,4125952,"Look, we're gonna
move out in two hours."
790,4126080,4127840,Why don't you get some sleep?
791,4127968,4130664,l don't know how he does it.
792,4130788,4132022,What's that?
793,4132149,4134745,"Falls asleep like that.
Look at him."
794,4134868,4137639,"He's lights-out
the minute his head's down."
795,4137762,4139064,Clear conscience.
796,4139187,4143748,"What's that saying? ''lf God's
on our side, who's on theirs?''"
797,4143873,4147115,"''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''"
798,4147238,4148620,"Yeah, what did l say?"
799,4148750,4150117,"Well, actually,"
800,4150244,4153583,"the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake."
801,4153706,4155539,"How is that, Wade?"
802,4155661,4160290,"My mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,"
803,4160415,4162242,"slept through the day,"
804,4162367,4166572,"so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home."
805,4166698,4171268,"So l used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,"
806,4171394,4174758,"but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,"
807,4174883,4176878,the faster l'd fall asleep.
808,4177632,4180121,"That wouldn't have
mattered in my house."
809,4180245,4183534,"My ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn."
810,4183658,4186627,"That woman
was never too tired to talk."
811,4186754,4190189,"Probably the only time
she could get a word in."
812,4193943,4198846,"Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,"
813,4198971,4201341,and l'd pretend to be asleep.
814,4201467,4204171,Who? You...your mom?
815,4204295,4205424,Yeah.
816,4207608,4210456,"She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me."
817,4211580,4214079,And l'd just keep my eyes shut.
818,4216411,4220403,"l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,"
819,4220527,4222270,that she came home early...
820,4224645,4227370,just to talk to me.
821,4229131,4230845,And l still wouldn't move.
822,4230971,4233469,"l'd still pretend
to just be asleep."
823,4241163,4244700,l don't know why l did that.
824,4256937,4260676,"We only got a couple hours.
Go to sleep."
825,4269206,4272645,Captain? Sir?
826,4274225,4275643,Corporal?
827,4280380,4283996,"How you doin' there?
You all right?"
828,4284121,4288440,"Yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir."
829,4288566,4290907,Really?
830,4291033,4293034,How is that?
831,4296195,4298855,"''War educates the senses,"
832,4298939,4300892,"''calls into action the will,"
833,4301018,4304053,"''perfects the physical
constitution,"
834,4304178,4307112,"''brings men into such
swift and close collision"
835,4307237,4310504,"''in critical moments
that man measures man.''"
836,4310630,4313298,"Yeah, well, l guess
that's Emerson's way"
837,4313422,4315378,of finding the bright side.
838,4315502,4319743,"- You know Emerson, sir?
- l know some."
839,4323523,4328048,"So where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?"
840,4329682,4331686,What's the pool up to?
841,4335432,4339092,"You know, l think
it's around 300, sir."
842,4339217,4341626,"Well, when it gets up to 500,"
843,4341751,4346005,"l'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?"
844,4346131,4350071,"Well, sir, l feel it's my duty
under your command"
845,4350196,4354198,"to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir."
846,4356111,4358772,"What if we don't
live that long?"
847,4361160,4364652,"- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah."
848,4364776,4365701,"Yes, sir."
849,4365826,4367171,Yeah.
850,4369352,4371063,"Get some sleep, Corporal."
851,4371189,4372187,"Yes, sir."
852,4438450,4440196,Who's got sulphur powder?
853,4443269,4445610,Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
854,4445737,4447038,He needs a tourniquet!
855,4447164,4449136,"- Wade.
- Yes, sir?"
856,4449261,4451641,"- Do what you can.
- Yes, sir."
857,4451766,4453141,"Hold on, fellas."
858,4453268,4454722,lt won't be much longer.
859,4454846,4457302,How we doing here?
860,4457426,4458755,All right.
861,4458879,4461210,"Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it."
862,4461335,4463283,Doc's in town.
863,4463409,4464699,"lt's all right.
lt's all right."
864,4464827,4468728,"The 29th lnfantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon."
865,4468854,4471154,Plasma. Anybody got plasma?
866,4471281,4475193,"- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, want to fill me in?"
867,4475319,4477022,"Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant DeWindt, sir."
868,4477148,4480372,"99th Troop Carrier Squadron
carrying 327th Glider lnfantry."
869,4480497,4484196,"This one was mine.
l was the pilot. 22 dead."
870,4484320,4488429,"l ended up without a scratch.
Took my co-pilot's head off."
871,4488556,4490355,"Well, who are these people?"
872,4490480,4494730,"The guys we came with,
they headed off first night."
873,4494855,4498847,"Other guys keep showing up.
One, two, half-dozen at a time."
874,4498971,4501881,"Then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,"
875,4502007,4504252,"head off to make trouble, sir."
876,4504376,4506264,"We're looking for
Private James Ryan."
877,4506388,4508569,"Baker Company, 506 of the 101st."
878,4508696,4510078,"No, you got me, sir."
879,4510203,4511413,"A lot of guys
come in and out of here."
880,4512621,4513580,Check that squad.
881,4513706,4517488,"- See if Ryan's in it.
- Yes, sir."
882,4518779,4523016,"Smell that leg right there.
ls it south of cheese?"
883,4529464,4530550,What?
884,4536130,4538543,Keep moving. Keep moving!
885,4540746,4542531,"l'm Juden, you know?"
886,4542655,4545032,Ju-den.
887,4545156,4548135,"Yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there,"
888,4548261,4550438,"- l'd need a winch.
- Yeah."
889,4554025,4554979,Stars.
890,4555105,4558181,"Yep, Brigadier General Amend,"
891,4558308,4561067,"Deputy Commander, 101st."
892,4561192,4563557,"Some fucking genius
had the idea"
893,4563682,4565566,of welding steel plates on
894,4565691,4568583,"to keep the general safe
from ground fire."
895,4568711,4570885,"Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me"
896,4571011,4572803,until we were getting airborne.
897,4572927,4574885,"That's like flying
a freight train."
898,4575009,4576091,OK?
899,4576217,4577505,Gross overload.
900,4577630,4580291,"Trim characteristics
all shot to hell."
901,4580415,4583386,"l nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level."
902,4583510,4585390,"And when...and when we released,"
903,4585518,4589501,"l cut as hard as l could,
tried to gain altitude"
904,4589628,4591549,and still keep from stalling.
905,4591673,4593591,Came down like a fucking meteor.
906,4593716,4596502,Here's how we ended up.
907,4596627,4598624,"And the others,"
908,4598746,4601241,"they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?"
909,4601367,4605278,"We were just...we were
just too damn heavy, you know?"
910,4605404,4607670,The grass was wet.
911,4607797,4610102,Downward slope and all.
912,4610227,4613019,22 guys dead.
913,4615267,4617055,All that for a general?
914,4617181,4619260,One man.
915,4621089,4624247,"- Lot of that going around.
- Fubar."
916,4624371,4625669,Fubar.
917,4625797,4627138,Fubar.
918,4627264,4628566,Fubar.
919,4628690,4630741,Y'all got that right.
920,4631993,4635033,"l looked in a German dictionary.
There's no ''fubar'' in there."
921,4635157,4636198,"- Upham.
- Yes, sir?"
922,4636322,4638983,"There's more paratroops.
Find out if one's Ryan."
923,4639066,4640063,"Yes, sir."
924,4640189,4643136,"You might want
to check these out, sir."
925,4643259,4645012,Dog tags.
926,4645140,4648703,"More than l really
want to count, sir."
927,4648831,4651838,"l've...l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir."
928,4651966,4654050,Jackson...
929,4654173,4655628,start going through those.
930,4655754,4656709,"Yes, sir."
931,4658291,4660120,l'll help.
932,4661699,4664066,What do you think? He in there?
933,4664190,4666370,"lf he is, l'll find him."
934,4666495,4668255,l bet he is.
935,4668382,4671393,10 bucks says l nail him first.
936,4671521,4675102,"- Who we got...?
- You don't stand a chance."
937,4675225,4678677,"- You think he's in here?
- Just keep looking."
938,4678803,4680964,All right. Gary lanico.
939,4681088,4682293,Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.
940,4682416,4684622,"All the Guineas
are buying it, huh?"
941,4684746,4687076,"Oh, come on,
not the right name."
942,4687203,4689341,"Wee Willie Winkie,
that's your buddy."
943,4689467,4691641,We gotta find this prick.
944,4695930,4698133,Where is this sonofabitch?
945,4698258,4701332,"Don't mix them up?
Keep them in your pile."
946,4701457,4703323,How will l know who's here?
947,4703448,4706211,"Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?"
948,4706335,4707636,Everybody be friends.
949,4707760,4709313,"Cranky there, huh?"
950,4710778,4712112,l got a winner.
951,4712239,4713570,What you talking about?
952,4713696,4715026,Ryan.
953,4715153,4716150,Ryan?
954,4716275,4718063,"Look at that, Mellish."
955,4718189,4721802,"You're a genius, you really are.
R-l-E-N-N-E."
956,4721928,4725259,"That's Rienne. That's French.
You know what that means?"
957,4725384,4726643,lt means nothing.
958,4726769,4731042,"- Three of a kind.
- All from New York."
959,4731167,4732626,"Do you need
a hand with that?"
960,4732750,4734126,l got a full house.
961,4734252,4736123,Got you beat. Straight flush.
962,4736248,4739616,"You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?"
963,4739740,4740778,Ryan.
964,4740903,4742479,"Fuckin' unreal, this guy."
965,4742607,4743977,Do you need a hand with that?
966,4744100,4745358,Can you read that shit?
967,4745482,4747788,"Jesus, look at
this poor bastard."
968,4747914,4749549,"They're not bulletproof, huh?"
969,4749677,4751057,Guess not. All right?
970,4751181,4752556,What's between his ears?
971,4752681,4756054,"Sort of what you
fellas got between your legs."
972,4756177,4758589,We got to give him that.
973,4758714,4760513,"Not bad, Jackson."
974,4760642,4765050,"What the hell are you doing?
The whole Airborne's watching."
975,4765178,4766267,These aren't chips.
976,4766392,4769959,"- All right, all right.
- Put 'em back in!"
977,4793957,4795577,He's not here.
978,4798366,4799652,Put 'em back.
979,4799779,4802561,"Maybe we should split
into groups, huh?"
980,4802686,4805269,"Wander the woods,
calling his name."
981,4805393,4807952,"He'll hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!"
982,4808079,4811760,"That might be a little hard
to do, Captain."
983,4811886,4815052,"Maybe the locals... Hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi."
984,4815177,4817089,"Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?"
985,4817214,4818753,Merci. Merci beaucoup.
986,4818878,4820790,"Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,

1023,4922708,4924746,"Write ''thank you.''
Read, and thank you."
1024,4924870,4926085,You're welcome!
1025,4926214,4927344,Assemble on me.
1026,4929609,4931159,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
1027,4934283,4936488,Ramelle.
1028,4936613,4939854,We're here. There.
1029,4939980,4941019,Ramelle...
1030,4941144,4945053,"is on the Merderet river,
just south-west of us."
1031,4945180,4948869,"You know anything about
this bridge, Captain?"
1032,4948993,4952338,"Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg."
1033,4952463,4956127,"We can't push on Paris
without a deep water port,"
1034,4956252,4957791,"Rommel knows that,"
1035,4957915,4962335,"so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river."
1036,4962462,4967390,"Then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to Cherbourg."
1037,4967514,4972618,"That makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate."
1038,4992964,4994923,Let's go.
1039,5003757,5005511,Captain.
1040,5043784,5045414,What the hell is that?
1041,5047215,5050400,"A radar site.
Must be out of action."
1042,5050526,5052612,"Looks like there's
something in that..."
1043,5052736,5055155,"sandbag bunker
right under the station."
1044,5056234,5057192,See it?
1045,5057315,5059145,"Yeah. That's my guess, too."
1046,5060850,5063175,What is it?
1047,5063298,5065553,Machine gun. Probably MG-42.
1048,5065678,5067942,"Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?"
1049,5068068,5070539,Maybe one of them's our boy.
1050,5070667,5073041,"No, their patches are 82nd."
1051,5073169,5075998,"l don't know
how fast you guys are,"
1052,5076126,5079866,"but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here."
1053,5081029,5084978,"So, Captain,
let's just go around it."
1054,5085106,5088794,"l hear what you're saying,
but we can't."
1055,5088918,5092014,"l'm with Reiben
on this one, sir."
1056,5092138,5095807,"- We left them 88s.
- For the Air Force."
1057,5095929,5099881,"The Air Force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun."
1058,5100003,5102080,"Uh, Captain..."
1059,5102204,5105183,"We skip it and still
accomplish our mission."
1060,5105311,5107869,"l mean, this isn't
our mission, right?"
1061,5107993,5111511,"That's what you want to do,
just leave it here?"
1062,5111634,5113634,"Let them ambush
the next company?"
1063,5113758,5118170,"No, sir, l'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk"
1064,5118293,5119502,"given our objective, sir."
1065,5119626,5121868,Our objective is to win the war.
1066,5124861,5129347,"Sir, l just, uh, l don't have
a good feeling about this one."
1067,5130980,5134524,"When was the last time
you felt good about anything?"
1068,5156203,5159195,"All right, three runners
with suppressing fire."
1069,5159321,5161232,"Mellish, you hook to the right."
1070,5161358,5163115,l'll go up the middle.
1071,5163239,5164989,Who's going left?
1072,5171232,5172900,Who's going left?
1073,5177147,5179184,l'll do it.
1074,5179309,5180513,l'll go left.
1075,5180639,5182218,All right.
1076,5182340,5185885,"Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear."
1077,5186009,5187517,"Yes, sir."
1078,5187644,5191414,"We keep pressure on till
he has to change his barrels."
1079,5191539,5195206,"l think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range."
1080,5195330,5199281,"- l should take the middle, sir.
- The way you run?"
1081,5199404,5203725,"- Maybe l should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up."
1082,5203848,5206777,"Reiben, base of fire."
1083,5214995,5217946,"Mags and clips where
you can reach 'em, and..."
1084,5218069,5220732,"and extra grenades
for the base runners."
1085,5305235,5307496,"Hill's clear!
Four down and dead!"
1086,5307623,5310932,"Upham, grab the gear.
Get up here!"
1087,5311059,5313000,"We need water
and extra dressing now!"
1088,5313125,5315084,"Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!"
1089,5315209,5318120,"Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!"
1090,5328873,5330383,Son of a bitch!
1091,5330508,5332346,Get some sulphur on there.
1092,5332472,5333598,Move my legs up.
1093,5333723,5335474,"More sulphur, Mellish."
1094,5335596,5337842,"You're gonna be all right, doc."
1095,5337969,5339340,How's it look?
1096,5339464,5341584,"Wade, you're going
on a hospital ship."
1097,5341707,5343035,More sulphur!
1098,5343161,5345745,"Put my legs up.
Put my legs up."
1099,5345873,5348595,l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.
1100,5348721,5350522,"Upham, give me your canteen!"
1101,5350649,5354362,Come on. Come on. come on.
1102,5354486,5355652,Put some pressure on it.
1103,5355777,5358439,"- You'll be OK.
- How's it look?"
1104,5358521,5361307,"- Give him morphine.
- How's it look?"
1105,5361431,5364023,"- All right.
- How's it look?"
1106,5364146,5365566,Here comes the morphine.
1107,5365692,5369294,Am l shot in the spine?
1108,5369421,5371053,"- You're OK, Wade."
1109,5371178,5372598,Am l shot in the spine?
1110,5372724,5374516,"Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy."
1111,5374642,5376057,Put some pressure on him.
1112,5376182,5377472,"Easy, easy."
1113,5377595,5378885,Lift him up.
1114,5381169,5384119,"lt's OK, doc. lt's all right."
1115,5384243,5386712,"Wade, you got an exit wound."
1116,5386839,5388470,lt's in the small of your back.
1117,5388596,5391151,"How big...how big's
the hole in the..."
1118,5391275,5393029,lt's about the size of an acorn.
1119,5393153,5394281,You're fine.
1120,5396945,5399188,Put some pressure on it.
1121,5399313,5402636,"Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it."
1122,5402759,5403840,lt's all right.
1123,5403964,5406808,Put some more pressure on it!
1124,5406936,5409949,"ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?"
1125,5410075,5411916,"Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is?"
1126,5412042,5413207,No.
1127,5413333,5415671,Here. l'll put your hand on it.
1128,5415794,5417689,Pressure on there.
1129,5417812,5419726,Right there. OK? That's the one.
1130,5419849,5423960,"Oh, my God, my liver!
Oh, my God! lt's my liver!"
1131,5424083,5427430,"Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you."
1132,5427555,5430280,"What can we do?
Tell us what to do."
1133,5430410,5432078,"Oh, shit."
1134,5432201,5436580,"l could use...l could use
a little more morphine."
1135,5437789,5439907,"More morphine, sir?"
1136,5446270,5447911,Give it to him.
1137,5449922,5451258,Give it to him.
1138,5456014,5457006,l don't wanna die.
1139,5457131,5460581,"Here you go, Wade. Here you go."
1140,5460710,5462204,There you go. There you...
1141,5465154,5467459,Give him another one.
1142,5474691,5476147,Mama?
1143,5478438,5480598,Mama?
1144,5480722,5484418,"l want to go home.

1145,5484546,5488102,Mama! Mama! Mam...
1146,5534214,5535297,"Reiben, hold him!"
1147,5556351,5557639,Not yet.
1148,5559469,5563431,"First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail."
1149,5565096,5568447,"Same thing for
those paratroopers down there."
1150,5568572,5570625,"Strip that stuff.
Check for intelligence."
1151,5570752,5573880,"Ask if he's the one
who shot Wade."
1152,5574007,5576839,"- lt doesn't matter.
- lt does matter!"
1153,5580539,5583196,"Shut up with that
filthy Pig Latin."
1154,5585027,5586283,"Jackson, you're hit."
1155,5589298,5591014,Shut up.
1156,5591141,5594228,"- lt just skinned me, sir.
- Get it dressed."
1157,5594354,5596936,"You and Sarge
watch the perimeter."
1158,5600012,5601756,He says please don't shoot.
1159,5601879,5603831,"l don't care, Upham."
1160,5605416,5608432,"Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?"
1161,5608559,5613700,"- This is not right, sir.
- Help him with the bodies."
1162,5616075,5618112,What is happening?
1163,5728369,5730400,American.
1164,5731490,5733828,l like American.
1165,5740985,5743267,Steamboat Willie.
1166,5743391,5745143,Steamboat Willie.

1168,5758589,5760374,He's says he's not finished.
1169,5760500,5761912,That's what you think.

your tongue! Cool beans!"
1174,5786399,5790628,Betty Boop! What a dish!
1175,5790753,5792885,Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1179,5814692,5816732,Fuck Hitler.
1180,5818811,5820806,Fuck Hitler.
1181,5827430,5830822,"Sir, he says
he's sorry about Wade."
1182,5830947,5833722,"He says he's sorry
about Wade, sir."
1183,5833849,5835813,Captain!
1184,5835938,5838058,"Captain, this isn't right!"
1185,5838182,5840386,You know this. He's a prisoner.
1186,5840510,5842006,He surrendered.
1187,5842129,5844123,"He surrendered, sir!"
1188,5854701,5856574,Tell him...
1189,5859027,5863015,"To march a thousand paces, then
he can take off the blindfold."
1190,5863140,5866896,"We'll be gone, and he turns
himself in to Allied patrols."
1191,5867021,5870202,"- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben."
1192,5870328,5872084,Can't take him with us.
1193,5872208,5874548,Our guys'll pick him up.
1194,5885194,5887871,"lf he isn't picked up
by the Wehrmacht,"
1195,5887999,5889922,"then thrown back
into circulation."
1196,5892307,5894644,"Captain, you just
let the enemy go."
1197,5894770,5896395,This is such bullshit.
1198,5896519,5897808,Y'all got that right.
1199,5897933,5900469,Bullshit? This is bullshit?
1200,5900594,5903709,"Shooting prisoners is OK?
lt's against the goddamn rules!"
1201,5903832,5906797,"The rules just walked
off with your friend."
1202,5908304,5911692,"But l guess that was
the decent thing to do,"
1203,5911820,5912780,"huh, Captain?"
1204,5920399,5922891,Get your gear. Let's go.
1205,5925263,5927481,You heard him. Gear up.
1206,5927604,5929699,"The Captain
just gave you an order."
1207,5929826,5933087,"Yeah. Like the one
to take this machine gun."
1208,5933210,5935465,"That was a real doozie, sarge."
1209,5935589,5937047,"Soldier, you're outta line."
1210,5937174,5940644,"Yes, sir, one hell of a call,
to take this nest."
1211,5940768,5944048,"But, what the hell,
we only lost one guy."
1212,5944175,5947726,"l hope mama Ryan's happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life"
1213,5947852,5949904,is more important than our guys!
1214,5950029,5953040,"But then, we haven't
found him yet, have we?"
1215,5954541,5956167,Get the hell off me!
1216,5956292,5957623,"Reiben, get up."
1217,5960035,5962690,Gear up. Fall in.
1218,5968258,5970144,l'm done with this mission.
1219,5978442,5979399,Sir.

Captain, get back in line."

if l have to."
1222,5986430,5988733,"- l won't ask again.
- Captain!"
1223,5988857,5990115,This is bullshit!
1224,5990241,5991203,Fall in!
1225,5991328,5994792,"- You'd shoot me over Ryan?
- No, l don't like you."
1226,5994918,5996792,Just let him go!
1227,5996917,5998705,Are you letting this happen?
1228,5998830,6000617,Captain! You see this?
1229,6000743,6004482,"- Captain? Sir? Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!"
1230,6004607,6008955,"- Sir, we have a situation.
- l have a sixth sense, l know."
1231,6009081,6012135,"You don't kill Krauts,
but you shoot me, huh?"
1232,6012261,6016598,"- He's better than you.
- Do it. Put one in my leg..."
1233,6016723,6018927,"l'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!"
1234,6019052,6020797,Put your money where your...
1235,6020922,6023620,You don't know when to shut up.
1236,6023745,6024745,"Captain, please!"
1237,6024870,6027212,What's the pool on me up to?
1238,6027339,6028426,What?
1239,6028551,6031728,"- You coward son of a bitch!

on me up to now?"
1241,6035365,6037735,What...what's it up to?
1242,6037858,6040315,"What is it, $300?

''Well, that figures.''"

if l've changed so much,"

whenever l get back to her."

1265,6129726,6133866,"well, then...
then that's my mission."
1266,6135576,6137411,You want to leave?
1267,6137534,6141402,"You want to go off
and fight the war?"
1268,6143192,6145646,All right.
1269,6145772,6148762,"All right, l won't stop you."
1270,6148885,6151104,l'll even put in the paperwork.
1271,6152694,6157656,"l just know, every man l kill,
the farther from home l feel."
1272,6242835,6246002,By memories
1273,6246129,6249896,Of days gone by
1274,6250024,6252633,ln my solitude
1275,6252758,6254972,You taunt me
1276,6255098,6256267,With memories
1277,6256392,6259717,That never die
1278,6259841,6262500,l sit in my chair
1279,6262584,6264747,Filled with despair
1280,6264871,6266667,There's no one
1281,6266792,6270181,Could be so sad
1282,6270307,6272104,With gloom everywhere
1283,6272230,6274402,l sit and l stare...
1284,6288187,6289945,Half-track! Cover!
1285,6306150,6310125,"Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?"
1286,6330014,6331854,Move on their left flank!
1287,6331976,6333189,Take their left flank!
1288,6333313,6335988,"Hold on, make sure they're down!"
1289,6357064,6360183,101st! We're coming out!
1290,6366942,6369788,"That was a recon element,
second SS."
1291,6369912,6374092,"We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it."
1292,6376972,6380253,"Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers."
1293,6380381,6382330,"Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, Five-o-first."
1294,6382456,6384075,"Ryan, First
of the Five-o-sixth."
1295,6384201,6386454,"PFC Toynbe,
Third of the Five-o-sixth."
1296,6386577,6388627,James Francis Ryan?
1297,6388756,6391472,"Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?"
1298,6403008,6406217,"Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard."
1299,6406342,6409898,"Yes, sir. Small unit action."
1300,6412027,6415288,"They beat the hell
out of us with 88s."
1301,6421318,6425731,"Sir, if you're our relief,
l'm gonna file a complaint."
1302,6425855,6427651,l wouldn't blame you.
1303,6427779,6430748,Who's your CO?
1304,6430873,6433714,"lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir."
1305,6433839,6437096,"The best we can muster now
is a corporal."
1306,6438259,6440751,"So, what are you guys
all about?"
1307,6441832,6445368,We're here for him. Ryan.
1308,6445494,6446997,"Me, sir?"
1309,6456525,6460083,James Francis Ryan of lowa?
1310,6460208,6462781,"Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct."
1311,6462907,6465447,What is this about?
1312,6467369,6470213,"Your brothers
were killed in combat."
1313,6476936,6479141,Which...which ones?
1314,6481259,6483046,All of them.
1315,6489305,6494656,Uh...On...on the level?
1316,6495782,6497658,Yeah. l'm afraid so.
1317,6497781,6502186,"Uh...You might want
to take some time with this."
1318,6502310,6505267,"lf there's someplace
you want to go and..."
1319,6514504,6518003,"- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers."
1320,6518131,6520788,"- Which one?
- All of them."
1321,6525153,6526530,You...
1322,6528079,6531884,"You came all the way
out here to tell me that?"
1323,6533888,6535893,"Well, you're...
you're going home."
1324,6537644,6540304,"Our orders are
to bring you back."
1325,6543500,6545167,Bring me back?
1326,6547299,6551521,"Corporal Henderson...l don't
mean to leave you short-handed,"
1327,6551645,6553861,but orders are orders.
1328,6553986,6555658,When are you being relieved?
1329,6555783,6558282,"Sir, we have no way to tell."
1330,6558405,6561689,"My orders don't include me
abandoning my post."
1331,6561813,6564745,"l understand that,
but this changes things."
1332,6564873,6567183,"l don't see that it does, sir."
1333,6568771,6572660,"The Chief of Staff for the
United States Army says it does."
1334,6572784,6575001,"Sir, we have
to hold this bridge."
1335,6575127,6578873,"The 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet"
1336,6578998,6581243,"except two,
at Valognes and here."
1337,6581366,6584693,"lf the Germans take 'em,
we'll have to displace."
1338,6584818,6589120,"Private, your outfit stays,
but your party's over here."
1339,6589247,6591462,"Sir, l can't leave
until reinforcements..."
1340,6591588,6593844,You got three minutes.
1341,6593968,6595891,"Sir, what about them?
There's barely..."
1342,6596017,6597848,"Hey, asshole!"
1343,6597972,6602460,"Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?"
1344,6606835,6608716,Sir?
1345,6608842,6610098,That's right.
1346,6619525,6621435,What were their names?
1347,6621561,6624220,lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.
1348,6625930,6627933,Wade and...
1349,6629483,6630988,Caparzo.
1350,6643527,6646069,lt doesn't make any sense.
1351,6647406,6651628,"lt doesn't make sense, sir.
Why do l deserve to go?"
1352,6651754,6655014,"Why not these guys?
They fought just as hard!"
1353,6659678,6662833,"ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother"
1354,6662958,6666332,"when they send her another
folded American flag?"
1355,6673128,6675802,"Tell her that when you found me,"
1356,6675887,6679506,"l was here with the only
brothers l have left,"
1357,6679630,6683742,"and that there's no way
l was gonna desert them."
1358,6683868,6686538,l think she'll understand that.
1359,6686619,6688752,"There's no way
l'm leaving this bridge."
1360,6732081,6733667,What are your orders?
1361,6735758,6739795,"Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here."
1362,6739921,6743200,"The world has taken
a turn for the surreal."
1363,6743326,6745867,"Clearly, but the question
still stands."
1364,6745994,6750005,l don't know. What do you think?
1365,6750134,6753181,"You don't want to know
what l think."
1366,6755229,6757231,"No, Mike, l do."
1367,6759103,6762344,"Well... part of me
thinks the kid's right."
1368,6762467,6764671,What's he done to deserve this?
1369,6764801,6769158,"lf he wants to stay here,
fine, let's leave him."
1370,6770331,6771679,Yeah.
1371,6771805,6774027,"But another part
of me thinks..."
1372,6774150,6777284,what if by some miracle we stay
1373,6777408,6780324,"and actually make it
out of here?"
1374,6780447,6782726,"Someday we might look
back and decide"
1375,6782850,6787271,"that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing"
1376,6787394,6794124,"we were able to pull out of this
whole God-awful, shitty mess."
1377,6794249,6798378,"That's what l was thinking, sir."
1378,6798506,6801164,"Like you said, Captain,"
1379,6802366,6806702,"if we do that...we all earn
the right to go home."
1380,6810420,6812218,"Oh, brother."
1381,6814893,6818270,This is everything.
1382,6818394,6820595,"Two .30-calibre machine guns,"
1383,6820719,6822300,"17 grenades,"
1384,6822424,6824710,1 1 Hawkins mines.
1385,6824836,6828134,"You got two bazookas,
but only eight rounds left,"
1386,6828259,6830099,and assorted small arms.
1387,6830224,6833025,"An arty round took out
our .60 mortar."
1388,6833152,6836661,"Might as well be spit wads
if they use tanks."
1389,6836785,6840235,"- Which they're sure to.
- What you thinking, sir?"
1390,6840360,6841482,Well...
1391,6841605,6845601,"l think they're going to try
to whip around the flanks..."
1392,6849278,6852830,"Unless we draw them up
here between these buildings,"
1393,6852954,6856422,"where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck."
1394,6856548,6858711,"- Disable him?
- lf we can."
1395,6858837,6862286,"Make the tank a 60-ton
roadblock, we'll have a chance."
1396,6862410,6864991,"Yes, sir,
don't let them mass anywhere."
1397,6865116,6867953,"Hit hard and fall back
to the bridge."
1398,6868079,6872509,"Machine gun moving, number two
up high to piss on their heads."
1399,6872634,6875099,That would be the idea.
1400,6875226,6877377,Jackson?
1401,6877501,6879621,"lf we can, l'd like to get
you up in that bell tower."
1402,6879747,6882902,"- Yes, sir.
- Give you company if need be."
1403,6883026,6884901,"Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt."
1404,6885026,6889203,"l'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be OK."
1405,6889327,6891083,"Parker, job opportunity."
1406,6891208,6893296,"Not the worst idea, Captain."
1407,6893422,6897182,"But it all depends on knocking
out the tank here, right?"
1408,6897308,6900176,"So how do you
plan on doing that?"
1409,6900302,6901755,Reiben's right.
1410,6901878,6904831,"As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,"
1411,6904957,6910012,"what we got here is spit wads,
so how do we stop the tank?"
1412,6910137,6911807,Give it a rabbit to chase.
1413,6911932,6915484,"We could hit the tank
in the tracks."
1414,6915609,6917447,"Yeah, but with what?"
1415,6919857,6922100,We could try a sticky bomb.
1416,6922225,6923720,"Sticky bomb, sir?"
1417,6924888,6929856,"- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. lt's in the field manual."
1418,6929984,6932697,"Well, we're out
of field manuals, sir."
1419,6932823,6934829,Perhaps you can enlighten us?
1420,6934954,6938415,"Right, you have demolition -
some TNT or composition B?"
1421,6938542,6942487,"l got that bridge wired
with enough to blow it twice."
1422,6942612,6944401,"You can spare some, then."
1423,6944526,6947990,"You take
a standard-issue Gl sock,"
1424,6948114,6951417,"cram it with as much
Comp' B as possible,"
1425,6951542,6953757,"rig up a simple fuse,"
1426,6953879,6956766,"then coat the whole
thing with axle grease."
1427,6956890,6959428,"When you throw it,
it should stick."
1428,6959552,6962293,"lt's a bomb that sticks.
A sticky bomb."
1429,6962419,6967475,"You know a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, tell me."
1430,6967602,6971488,"This is good. Now we got
to surrender our socks."
1431,6985426,6987011,Haul away.
1432,7000657,7004690,"Select the field of fire.
Cross with the bell tower."
1433,7004813,7007193,l can cover 12 to nine here.
1434,7011496,7014043,"- Easy!
- l got her!"
1435,7047846,7049352,Here are the mines.
1436,7060326,7063107,"For being the best we can do,"
1437,7063231,7067358,"that forward machine gun is not
in a terrible firing position."
1438,7069826,7071789,And this position right here...
1439,7074463,7076553,this is the Alamo.
1440,7076677,7080422,"They push us back here,
last man blows the bridge."
1441,7080546,7083037,"We only got a 30-second fuse,"
1442,7083161,7087562,"so that last man better hurry,
or he won't be alive long."
1443,7088732,7090364,Captain?
1444,7090490,7092868,Where am l during all this?
1445,7092996,7097049,"Never more than two feet from
me, and that's not negotiable."
1446,7098466,7100666,l'll get some ammo. Come on.
1447,7103697,7104905,"- Upham.
- Yes."
1448,7105035,7107077,"- Listen, all right?
- Yeah."
1449,7107200,7108664,"- Listening?
- Yes."
1450,7108788,7113257,"All right, we'll be displacing
and falling back like crazy..."
1451,7113382,7117394,"So be Johnny-on-the-spot
with ammo or we're dead."
1452,7117520,7119350,"- Right.
- Understand?"
1453,7119473,7122422,"- Johnny-on-the-spot.
- You all right?"
1454,7122547,7123836,Yeah.
1455,7124961,7127131,"When we shipped out of England,"
1456,7127258,7130473,"l told the supply sergeant
handing out cigarettes,"
1457,7130599,7132143,''l don't smoke.''
1458,7132272,7134233,''l don't smoke.''
1459,7135866,7138033,"Quite a situation, huh?"
1460,7138157,7140194,Unbelievable.
1461,7140318,7141232,Here.
1462,7141358,7145767,"Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?"
1463,7145893,7147810,"Yeah, you got that right."
1464,7150486,7151699,Fubar.
1465,7155250,7157297,"- Yeah, well...
- Fubar."
1466,7157422,7159999,"lt'll be a real show, huh?"
1467,7167632,7169390,Take it easy.
1468,7170684,7172062,Fubar.
1469,7210025,7211654,"Who's that singing, sir?"
1470,7213323,7214703,Edith Piaf.
1471,7216796,7219126,What's she so upset about?
1472,7220247,7221618,"Her lover left her,"
1473,7221743,7225237,"but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes."
1474,7226654,7228449,That would do it.
1475,7257656,7258903,''Even life itself
1476,7259028,7260564,''only represents you.
1477,7263722,7266517,"''Sometimes l dream
that l'm in your arms.''"
1478,7266639,7270109,"What was that part?
She sang that before."
1479,7270232,7271860,The chorus.
1480,7271987,7274954,"''And you speak softly
in my ear..."
1481,7276792,7278960,''and you say things
1482,7279083,7281201,"''that make my eyes close,"
1483,7283903,7285945,''and l find that marvellous.''
1484,7286070,7289202,"Uh, again...Upham, uh..."
1485,7289326,7293142,"to be honest, l...l find myself
curiously aroused by you."
1486,7294865,7298289,"Marvellous. No, it's...
it's a melancholy song."
1487,7298413,7302319,"At the beginning, she says,
''And then one day, you left."
1488,7302442,7306191,"''You left me, and, uh...
l've been desperate ever since."
1489,7306317,7309615,"''l see you all over the sky,
l see you all over the earth.''"
1490,7309739,7313874,"Any more of this, the Krauts
won't have to shoot me."
1491,7314000,7316256,l'll just slit my own wrists.
1492,7316385,7318759,"You're a strange bird, Upham."
1493,7318885,7320796,"Sorry, it's Edith, you know."
1494,7320921,7323744,"You know what
that song reminds me of?"
1495,7323869,7327291,"What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
said when l left for Basic."
1496,7327414,7329837,"What, ''Don't touch me''?"
1497,7329962,7332677,"No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife."
1498,7332801,7338234,"She tries things on in my mom's
shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE."
1499,7338357,7341016,"- Double-E?
- These things are massive."
1500,7341142,7342264,Those are big.
1501,7342387,7345928,"l've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42-D."
1502,7346052,7349267,"So she's trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,"

1505,7353023,7356160,"And it's beautiful,
she's just pouring out of it."
1506,7356284,7358287,"lt's beautiful, and she can tell"
1507,7358412,7362482,"l got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty."
1508,7362609,7364607,"And she says,
''Richard, calm down.''"
1509,7364731,7367150,"And says,
''When you're over there,"
1510,7367274,7370173,"''if you see anything
that upsets you,"
1511,7370299,7374976,"''just close your eyes and think
of these. You understand?''"
1512,7376858,7378816,"So l said, ''Yes, ma'am.''"
1513,7391900,7394154,"Are you all right, sir?"
1514,7394279,7396495,"Yeah, just keeping the rhythm."
1515,7402715,7406633,"ls it true you were
a teacher back home?"
1516,7406757,7408133,Yes.
1517,7408261,7410641,"See, that's something
l could never do"
1518,7410767,7415152,"Not after the way we treated
our teachers. No, sir."
1519,7417827,7420737,l had a thousand kids like you.
1520,7426354,7428692,l can't see my brothers' faces.
1521,7429903,7433036,"l've been trying,
and l can't see them."
1522,7433161,7435332,Has that ever happened to you?
1523,7435460,7438381,You gotta think of a context.
1524,7439920,7442036,What does that mean?
1525,7442163,7445992,"Well, you think about
something specific..."
1526,7446118,7447661,something you've done together.
1527,7451631,7455136,"When l think of home,
l think of something specific."
1528,7455265,7459060,"l think of my hammock
in the backyard or..."
1529,7459184,7464340,"my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves."
1530,7467925,7471308,"Well, this one night,
two of my brothers came"
1531,7471433,7475108,"and woke me up in
the middle of the night,"
1532,7475235,7478534,"and they said they had
a surprise for me."
1533,7478659,7482274,"They took me to the barn,
into the loft, and..."
1534,7482397,7484560,"there was
my oldest brother Dan..."
1535,7486187,7489527,with Alice...Alice Jardine.
1536,7491863,7496419,"l mean...picture a girl who took
a nosedive from the ugly tree"
1537,7496545,7498839,"and hit every branch
coming down."
1538,7501088,7503764,"And...and Dan's
got her shirt off."
1539,7503848,7506807,"So he's working on this bra,"
1540,7506931,7510524,"and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out..."
1541,7510647,7513655,"''Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!''"
1542,7516370,7518792,"And Alice Jardine screams,
and jumps up,"
1543,7518917,7523947,"and tries to get out,
but this shirt's over her head,"
1544,7524069,7527613,"and she runs into the wall
and knocks herself out."
1545,7527740,7531624,"So now Dan is so mad,
he starts coming after us,"
1546,7531749,7535675,"but Alice is there unconscious,
he's gotta wake her up."
1547,7535802,7538972,"So he grabs her leg,
and he's dragging her."
1548,7539096,7542584,"And he picks up a shovel
and goes after Sean."
1549,7542710,7547879,"Sean says, ''Why are you trying
to hit me? l did you a favour.''"
1550,7548003,7552388,"And this makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing."
1551,7552514,7556651,"lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern."
1552,7556775,7560606,"The thing explodes, and
the whole barn almost goes up."
1553,7576220,7579722,"That was it...Dan went
to Basic next day."
1554,7579847,7583752,"That was the last night
the four of us were together."
1555,7583878,7585878,That was two years ago.
1556,7590720,7594479,"Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes."
1557,7595900,7596861,No.
1558,7598322,7602021,No. That one l save just for me.
1559,7666539,7668167,Enemy from the east.
1560,7669796,7672510,"He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em."

1567,7695028,7696575,Everybody check your ammo!
1568,7697787,7699163,"Good luck, Reiben."

1571,7716862,7718865,"Yep, and tracers
point both ways."
1572,7718992,7722358,"Yeah? Check her head space
and she should run."
1573,7730653,7733156,Upham! Hustle up!
1574,7782953,7785036,"- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir."
1575,7785161,7787578,"We don't have
a .30-calibre here."
1576,7787704,7790627,"Either Mr Mellish
or Mr Jackson needs that."
1577,7790753,7791795,"Yes, sir."
1578,7792965,7794301,Upham! Jackson's fine.
1579,7794426,7795387,Turn around to Mellish.
1580,7817011,7820596,"l don't know if they
took the bait, Captain."
1581,7845642,7847977,You got any more of that?
1582,7893639,7895561,Panzers didn't take the bait.
