7,143810,148920,"I've seen one before. Many, many years ago."
8,150870,155730,It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
9,157570,162950,A man possessed of some radical notions.

16,178250,179340,An idea.

22,195740,198560,"Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered..."
23,198570,201349,and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.

28,210710,213250,Because I am the most skilled extractor.
29,213820,217469,"I know how to search your mind and
find your secrets. I know the tricks."
30,217470,220289,"And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep..."
31,220290,222880,your defense is never down.
32,223710,227590,"Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me."
33,227600,230659,"I need to know my way around

319,1588200,1591700,"Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this."
320,1591710,1596490,We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
321,1596500,1600080,"And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening."
322,1600090,1602960,That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
323,1602970,1605500,"How?
- By taking over the creating part."
324,1605510,1607300,"Now, this is where I need you."

to make them think that it's reality?"

something was actually strange."

331,1630800,1634160,"You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?"
332,1634170,1637370,You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
333,1637380,1638580,"I guess, yeah."
334,1638590,1640540,So how did we end up here?

509,2395390,2398390,if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
510,2399240,2400810,ARIADNE: What kind of tricks?
511,2400980,2404340,"In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes."
512,2404350,2408430,That lets you create closed loops... like the Penrose Steps.

514,2414040,2414930,See?
515,2419450,2420650,Paradox.
516,2420660,2422240,So a closed loop like that...
517,2422250,2425490,will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
518,2425500,2427620,But how big do these levels have to be?

the floor of a building to an entire city."

973,4310880,4313380,"The combination.
- I don't know it."
974,4313390,4316210,"Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know."
975,4316220,4321050,Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
976,4321060,4325760,You have one hour. Start talking.
977,4325770,4327140,FISCHER: You all right?
978,4327150,4328850,[GROANING]
979,4328860,4329520,You okay?
980,4331860,4332520,[GROANS]
981,4333860,4337120,Those bastards have had at me for two days.
982,4338200,4340860,They have someone with access to your father's office.
983,4340870,4342860,"They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah."
984,4342870,4345780,"They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it."
985,4345790,4348920,"Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?"
986,4349300,4352710,"Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it."
987,4352720,4355960,"No, he never gave me any combination."
988,4355970,4359810,"Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination."
989,4360560,4361479,"Well, what, then?"
990,4361480,4364269,"I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers..."
991,4364270,4368340,based on your experiences with Maurice.
992,4369980,4374240,"We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together."
993,4374660,4376700,Perhaps after your mother died.
994,4378780,4381790,"After my mother died, you know what he told me?"
995,4383260,4388159,"""Robert, there's really nothing to be said."""
996,4388160,4390790,"Oh, well, he was bad with emotion."
997,4390800,4394250,"I was 11, Uncle Peter."
998,4394260,4397670,"How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain."
999,4397680,4400780,"When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense."
1000,4401430,4403840,And if he dies?
1001,4403850,4405470,Worst-case scenario?
1002,4405480,4408350,"When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone."
1003,4408360,4412600,Cobb... I'll still honor the arrangement.
1004,4412620,4414820,"COBB: I appreciate that, Saito. But..."
1005,4415130,4418330,"when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement."
1006,4418880,4420990,Limbo is gonna become your reality.
1007,4421000,4425110,"You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man."
1008,4425120,4427210,Filled with regret?
1009,4428110,4429660,Waiting to die alone.
1010,4429670,4430630,No.
1011,4431330,4432800,I'll come back.
1012,4433800,4436430,And we'll be young men together again.
1013,4442630,4443630,Breathe.
1014,4443930,4446689,"These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination."
1015,4446690,4448930,"They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them."
1016,4448940,4452970,"They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river."
1017,4452980,4454900,All right. What is in the safe?
1018,4455700,4457030,Something for you.
1019,4457360,4461790,Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
1020,4461960,4465490,"A... A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn."
1021,4465500,4466860,That's an alternate.
1022,4466870,4469410,This would supersede the other if you want it to.
1023,4469420,4472200,It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
1024,4472210,4475880,It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
1025,4476090,4478430,Destroying my whole inheritance?
1026,4480280,4484040,"Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know."
1027,4486270,4488060,"He loved you, Robert."
1028,4488810,4490400,In his own way.
1029,4490600,4492360,FISCHER: In his own way.
1030,4493690,4495030,At the end...
1031,4496510,4498610,he called me in to his deathbed.
1032,4499200,4500910,He could barely speak.
1033,4502120,4506000,But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
1034,4508930,4510630,He pulled me close.
1035,4513330,4515130,And I could only make out...
1036,4516280,4517550,one word.
1037,4521410,4523640,"""Disappointed."""
1038,4527510,4528770,[SIGHS]
1039,4529100,4530560,When were you in limbo?
1040,4531650,4535310,"You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job."
1041,4535320,4537890,"But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?"
1042,4537900,4542190,"The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall."
1043,4542380,4546400,The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
1044,4546410,4548990,"And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer..."
1045,4549180,4551210,we're also going deeper into you.
1046,4551620,4555210,And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
1047,4558920,4560540,We were working together.
1048,4560550,4564420,We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
1049,4564430,4565840,I kept pushing things.
1050,4565850,4569640,I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.
1051,4570020,4575020,"I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there..."
1052,4575060,4577570,that we could get trapped so deep that when we...
1053,4578610,4581820,wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
1054,4582530,4584830,we lost sight of what was real.
1055,4591120,4595320,We created. We built the world for ourselves.
1056,4595330,4598450,We did that for years.
1057,4598460,4601790,We built our own world.
1058,4601800,4604670,How long were you stuck there?
1059,4604680,4606510,Something like 50 years.
1060,4610180,4611810,Jesus.
1061,4613640,4615140,How could you stand it?
1062,4615150,4618050,"It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods."
1063,4618060,4621270,The problem was knowing that none of it was real.
1064,4621280,4625700,"Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that."
1065,4626120,4627870,And what about for her?
1066,4630700,4634580,"She had looked something away, something deep inside her."
1067,4636000,4641220,"A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget."
1068,4644170,4648000,Limbo became her reality.
1069,4648010,4650340,What happened when you woke up?
1070,4650350,4654650,"Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades..."
1071,4655100,4659480,to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
1072,4660520,4664150,"I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it."
1073,4665650,4668360,"Eventually, she told me the truth."
1074,4668370,4671860,She was possessed by an idea.
1075,4671870,4677330,This one very simple idea that changed everything.
1076,4678650,4681050,That our world wasn't real.
1077,4682130,4686920,"That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that, uhh..."
1078,4686930,4689180,in order to get back home...
1079,4690550,4692390,we had to kill ourselves.
1080,4698980,4702600,"What about your children?
- She thought they were projections..."
1081,4702610,4705770,that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
1082,4705780,4707640,"MAL: I'm their mother!
- COBB: Calm down."
1083,4707650,4709060,I can tell the difference.
1084,4709070,4711560,"If this is my dream, why can't I control this?"
1085,4711570,4713440,You don't know you're dreaming!
1086,4713450,4715820,COBB: She was certain there was nothing I could do...
1087,4715830,4719500,"no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded."
1088,4722630,4725759,"She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone."
1089,4725760,4727760,"She loved me too much, so..."
1090,4728690,4732060,she came up with a plan on our anniversary.
1091,4758410,4761360,"Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me."
1092,4761370,4765790,"Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on."
1093,4765800,4770420,"No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me."
1094,4770430,4771640,"No, I'm not."
1095,4772300,4774390,"Now, you listen to me."
1096,4774970,4779380,"If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die."
1097,4779390,4781470,"Now, just step back inside."
1098,4781480,4784390,Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
1099,4784400,4785860,We've talked enough.
1100,4788560,4790370,"Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge..."
1101,4790380,4792920,"or I'll jump right now.
- Okay."
1102,4797200,4799860,We're gonna talk about this.
1103,4799870,4801200,All right?
1104,4801590,4806130,"I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey."
1105,4807250,4810410,"No, I can't. You know I can't do that."
1106,4810420,4813330,"Take a second, think about our children."
1107,4813340,4815840,Think about James.
1108,4815850,4817630,"Think about Phillipa, now."
1109,4817640,4820720,"If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway."
1110,4820730,4824470,"What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney..."
1111,4824480,4827490,explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
1112,4830240,4832410,How you've threatened to kill me.
1113,4834990,4837770,"Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom."
1114,4837780,4839690,Why did...? Why would you do this to me?
1115,4839700,4842740,I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
1116,4842750,4845950,We're going home to our real children.
1117,4845960,4849740,"Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?"
1118,4849750,4851540,You're waiting for a train.
1119,4851700,4853420,"Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!"
1120,4853430,4855520,A train that will take you far away.
1121,4855530,4859590,"James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
- You know where you hope this train will take you..."
1122,4859600,4861460,"They're waiting for you!
- ...but you can't know for sure."
1123,4861470,4864170,"Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter."
1124,4864180,4867430,"Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together."
1125,4867440,4871220,"Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!"
1126,4871230,4873360,Jesus Christ!
1127,4876260,4880070,She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
1128,4880080,4884400,"It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness."
1129,4884410,4885820,So I ran.

trying to buy my way back ever since."
1135,4906980,4911010,Your guilt defines her. It's what powers her.
1136,4911020,4915560,But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
1137,4915570,4918270,And if we are gonna succeed in this...
1138,4918280,4923210,"you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her."
1139,4923450,4925450,But you don't have to do that alone.
1140,4925460,4928360,"No, you're not...

1144,4941800,4944710,All right. I don't know any combination.
1145,4944720,4947970,"Not consciously, anyway.
- COBB: How about instinctively, huh?"
1146,4947980,4952100,"I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination."
1147,4952110,4955140,"Give me the first six numbers

1165,5070940,5073590,whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
1166,5073600,5076400,We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
1167,5076770,5079430,What about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.
1168,5079440,5082450,"No, I think we run with Mr. Charles.

1173,5092450,5095880,"The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces."
1174,5095890,5097850,"Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?"
1175,5097860,5100410,"I need some kind of distraction.

1688,7799870,7803610,I was disappointed...
1689,7803620,7805560,that you tried.
1690,7822680,7823340,[BEEPING]
1691,7828810,7829470,What?
1692,7840040,7841440,"Come on, come on."

1696,7927040,7930610,Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!
1697,7930620,7931280,I will!
1698,7972460,7975370,You remember when you asked me to marry you?
1699,7975380,7976660,Yes.
1700,7976670,7980180,You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
1701,7982430,7983730,But we did.
1702,7985850,7987950,We did. You don't remember?

1705,8001440,8003850,And I have to let you go.
1706,8005620,8007910,I have to let you go.
1707,8058950,8060760,"I'm sorry, Robert."

1709,8087870,8091120,"You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man..."
1710,8092550,8094250,not just to live for him.
1711,8096200,8098250,"That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter."
1712,8108300,8110000,What happened?
1713,8110010,8111880,"Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?"
1714,8111890,8115420,"No, to find Saito."
1715,8115430,8119720,He'll be lost.
1716,8119730,8121530,"No, he'll be all right."
1717,8137580,8140290,SAITO: Have you come to kill me?
1718,8143840,8146180,I'm waiting for someone.
1719,8150760,8153850,COBB: Someone from a half-remembered dream.
1720,8156270,8157480,Cobb?
1721,8158690,8159590,[SCOFFS]
1722,8159600,8161270,Impossible.
1723,8161900,8164440,We were young men together.
1724,8166110,8168280,I'm an old man.
1725,8169700,8171870,Filled with regret.
1726,8174870,8177580,Waiting to die alone.
1727,8180750,8182830,I've come back for you.
1728,8186210,8190180,To remind you of something.
1729,8193340,8195770,Something you once knew.
1730,8198560,8201360,That this world is not real.
1731,8205730,8210070,To convince me to honor our arrangement?
1732,8211070,8214280,"To take a leap of faith, yes."
1733,8219910,8221500,Come back...
1734,8223790,8226920,so we can be young men together again.
