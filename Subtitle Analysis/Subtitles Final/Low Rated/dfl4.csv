the short version"
24,315516,317718,'cause you're a short person.
25,317752,323691,"It all started when Nana
and your great grandpa,"
26,323724,325860,"Gabriel, when they first came
to America."
27,325893,326994,And they roamed the land
28,327028,331498,"for many, many, many years
searching for a new home."
29,331532,335536,"Back then Nana used to ride
on top of my father's back."
30,338739,340007,"That's how they used to get
around back then."
31,342475,344946,"So, after all this following,
this lookin' and searching,"
32,344979,346914,finally the found it.
33,346948,348015,A new home.
34,348049,351719,"A nasty, cramped, little shoebox
with a broke window,"
35,351752,353754,"a mattress, and three rats,"
36,353788,355556,"on a crappy little street
in Brooklyn."
37,355590,356456,Park Slope.
38,356489,357892,You ever been to Park Slope?
39,357925,359126,Didn't think so.
40,359160,362495,"So we would sit up by the broke
window with them three rats"
41,362530,364464,and we'd look out that window
42,364497,369469,"at all them other families out
there having their lavish parties"
43,369503,372974,"and all their home-cooked pies
and their roasted turkeys"
44,373007,375977,"and their stuffing with
topped cranberries"
45,376010,380447,"and mountains of mashed potatoes
and gravy, all that fancy stuff."
46,380480,386087,"All them families out there,
except for us."
47,389857,391491,Why?
48,391525,395730,'Cause we was broke.
49,395763,397932,We had nothing.
50,402803,405740,"So every-every year about
this time we get together"
51,405773,410878,"as a family and we shove it
in Brooklyn's face."
52,414248,417518,"Yeah, that's Thanksgiving."

73,506107,509643,"Yeah, I got family here."
74,509677,511545,"Is there something
that you need?"
75,535770,537872,"You know, Fonse."
76,537905,542576,"What you need is a good
fuckin' mechanic."
77,542610,544111,Get a nice oil change.
78,544145,545679,It's not the fuckin' oil.
79,547815,553320,"You remember that 341A?

83,560261,563064,"The Cadillac, the one you got down
in Wabash."
84,563097,565099,It was Hammond.
85,565132,566267,It was the modern one.
86,566300,567334,"Yeah, yeah, it was the modern
one, but it was Hammond."
87,567368,570204,"I can't remember was that dark
green, dark green"

89,572873,576177,You alright?
90,576210,579647,Yeah. Dark green.
91,579680,583884,"You know, Fonse, the kids are
all going back up next week."
92,583918,587755,"And I was thinking, maybe I'd
stay down here with you and Mae."
93,587788,590124,Me too.
94,592259,593427,Pops?
95,593461,595896,"You're gonna have to give up
some stuff if you wanna stay"
96,595930,597798,"in the house through
the next year"
97,597832,601001,"so we figured we'd stay here
and help you sort it out."
98,601035,603370,"Between all your statues
and the painting collection"
99,603404,607708,"I- I think we could bag us
at least 200, you know?"
100,607741,610411,"I mean, look,
I know this ain't easy."
101,610444,612179,"But if you don't get all this
stuff outta here soon"
102,612213,614014,"and make some bread, Fonse,"
103,614048,616383,"you're gonna be
completely screwed."
104,619220,622790,That's the truth.
105,622823,624658,"We're just worried about you,
Fonse."
106,624692,625893,That's all.
107,626827,628762,Ah! Fuck!

112,663764,665232,Where'd that come from?
113,665266,667401,"Bladder, pop."

198,1247314,1248883,Diapers?
199,1250685,1252987,"There's plenty here, as well."
200,1253020,1254922,"How's his energy been
during the day?"
201,1254956,1255890,He's awake.
202,1255923,1257390,How's his...
203,1260661,1262930,"So we're still having
nightmares, are we?"
204,1265600,1267802,"Fonse, could I have
your attention for a moment?"
205,1267835,1269704,Fonse.
206,1269737,1272006,You know who I am?
207,1278478,1281983,J. Edgar Hoover.
208,1282016,1283450,Who sent this fucking guy?
209,1283483,1284351,I did.
210,1284384,1284952,I'm your doctor.
211,1291659,1292894,Shh!
212,1292927,1293861,They're just working.
213,1293895,1295062,Sit down.
214,1296831,1298599,"Stop yelling at them.
Come on."
215,1299167,1302369,"I understand things are
tightening up financially."
216,1302402,1308576,"But all of these personal
artifacts just disappearing."
217,1308609,1311579,"The best thing for Fonse
has gotta be to try to keep"
218,1311612,1316083,"things as familiar
for him as you all can manage."
219,1316117,1318619,"The last thing we want is
for him to..."
220,1318653,1319921,Get another stroke.
221,1319954,1320988,Mmmhmm.
222,1321022,1323124,"He's not coughing
as much anymore."
223,1323157,1324058,He's got his good days...
224,1325760,1327494,Sit down!
225,1328963,1330965,"Honey, sit down!"
226,1336469,1339106,"I want to tell you something,"
227,1340641,1343410,"and I mean this with
the utmost respect."
228,1343443,1346080,"You should consider letting
the family stay."
229,1346113,1351384,"Having a man or two around just
in case he gets more confused"
230,1351418,1354055,"and hurts himself or
somebody else."
231,1354088,1358526,"Twenty-eight years I had to wait
for some peace and quiet."
232,1362029,1364364,He don't scare me.
233,1367434,1370037,You call me any time.
234,1370071,1372573,We got the diapers.
235,1377111,1381616,"Well, it's always nice
to see you, Mae."

247,1451986,1455222,"Nah, nah, nah, I just-
uh, hold on a second."
248,1457758,1459760,How's my pal?
249,1463731,1465533,No kidding.
250,1465566,1466466,Of course. Of course.
251,1466499,1471238,"Yeah, I can... I can be
down there Monday."
252,1471272,1474675,"Yeah, no problem."
253,1474709,1477178,"It'll be great to see
both of you."
254,1477211,1478980,I'll see you soon.
255,1488255,1490524,I'm going to Florida.
256,1512313,1513247,Florida?
257,1513280,1515082,"How come you ever take me
to Florida?"
258,1515116,1517084,"Uh, Tiff, I got business."
259,1517118,1518252,Trout season?
260,1518285,1520021,"More like running around
with your gangster friends"
261,1520054,1521288,in a swamp.
262,1521322,1522556,"Come on, doll face."
263,1522590,1524091,You know Al needs me.
264,1524125,1526127,He don't trust nobody else.
265,1540107,1543244,"Chicolini here
might look like an idiot,"
266,1543277,1548115,"he might talk like an idiot,
but don't let that fool ya."
267,1548149,1550584,He really is an idiot.
268,1550618,1553054,"I say we give him 10 years
in Leavenworth"
269,1553087,1556023,"or we give him 11 years
in Twelve worth."
270,1556057,1558125,Tell ya what I'd do.
271,1558159,1561729,"I'd take the five to ten
in Woolworth."
272,1561762,1562763,Jesus.
273,1562797,1565299,You sound like a dying horse.
274,1567201,1568969,Nice place you got here.

554,2701435,2703137,"Come on up, Al."

610,3024358,3027327,It don't matter to me.
611,3027361,3029831,You understand?
612,3029864,3031431,You understand?
613,3031465,3032399,"Whatever you say, Gino."
614,3032432,3034067,Yeah.
615,3038171,3040374,"Catch you later, Fonse."
616,3044344,3046514,Hey boss. Let's go.
617,3047615,3049182,Come on.
618,3051351,3053253,"Jesus Christ, look at this."
619,3057291,3058593,Get this bum outta here.
620,3058626,3060528,"Alright, you heard him."
621,3060562,3063130,Let's clean this shit up.
622,3072372,3073775,Hey!
623,3080582,3082617,"Ok, boss. We'll be out front."
624,3082650,3084384,Yeah.
625,3102704,3103838,Where's the kid?
626,3110177,3111613,Ow.
627,3125893,3127829,Where's the kid?
628,3127862,3130665,He's at my place.
629,3146246,3148382,Where is it?
630,3155657,3157357,You hear that?
631,3161294,3162462,Si.
632,3172339,3173941,Ahhh...
633,3230932,3233634,"Hey, watch your mouth!
Watch your mouth!"
634,3233668,3236504,Shoot those fucker!
635,3236537,3237572,Piece of shit!
636,3237605,3241509,"Don't let them get away!
You fuckers, fuck you!"
637,3258593,3260061,I'm sorry.
638,3261529,3262530,I'm sorry.
639,3271906,3273440,Hey!
640,3274575,3276711,Hey!
641,3282482,3284018,Hey!
642,3284051,3285520,"No, wait!"
643,3319086,3322056,"Oh god, please, no."
644,3389624,3392994,He had a stroke.
645,3393027,3394862,And?
646,3394896,3399700,He'll live.
647,3399734,3403004,I'll stay with him for a while.
648,3403037,3406674,"Maybe I can get him
to talk with me."
649,3406707,3410645,"Well, if you don't get
some answers, Doc,"
650,3410678,3413114,"the clemency is as good
as dead."
651,3416584,3418753,I'll see what I can do.
652,3460628,3462462,Good morning.
653,3463664,3465967,Sss...
654,3466000,3467201,What?
655,3467234,3468903,Snakes...
656,3468936,3470137,You want water?
657,3470171,3471072,Eh.
658,3471105,3473741,"Can you answer me
some questions first?"
659,3475643,3479547,"How many fingers
am I holding?"
660,3479580,3482249,Hmm?
661,3482283,3484752,F- f-four.
662,3484785,3487822,Mmmhmm.
663,3487855,3491792,How old are you?
664,3491826,3494962,Four...
665,3494996,3498165,No. You're 48 years old.
666,3498199,3502570,You're 48.
667,3502603,3506140,"Here you go, Fonse.
There you go."
668,3506173,3508976,Ok.
669,3509010,3510878,Get it all in there.
670,3515116,3517818,"He's sustained a permanent
degree of damage"
671,3517852,3520187,to his brain functions.
672,3520221,3522957,"Minor paralysis
on his left side,"
673,3522990,3524992,"mainly up his shoulder
to his mouth,"
674,3525026,3528062,"although I suspect that could
get a little better over time"
675,3528095,3530064,with daily rehabilitation.
676,3530097,3533601,"We ain't goin' anywhere,
so we're here."
677,3533634,3537038,"I think that would be best.
For his sake."
678,3537071,3540174,"There's a few changes
that we need to make."
679,3540207,3542076,No cigars.
680,3542109,3543778,For how long?
681,3545379,3547014,Ever.
682,3551352,3556624,"I suggest we give
him one of these."
683,3565166,3566901,"What is he, fuckin' Bugs Bunny?"
684,3568069,3570271,"He's going to go on a fuckin'
rampage."
685,3570304,3571472,I'm sorry.
686,3571506,3574708,"We want to keep him alive
and as comfortable as possible"
687,3574742,3576977,"for as long as we have
him here."
688,3577011,3579613,"He ain't gonna
fall for that shit?"
689,3579647,3582083,He's gonna have to accept it.
690,3582116,3583784,I'm sorry.
691,3597098,3598365,Ah...
692,3602837,3605005,Are you finished?
693,3605039,3606173,Eh.
694,3606207,3607374,Ok.
695,3607408,3609210,"That looks great, Fonse."
696,3609243,3610177,"Tell you what, let's-"
697,3611278,3616183,"Let's put that with
your collection right here."
698,3616217,3620254,"I'm gonna let you choose
the next one."
699,3636770,3639039,"Well, now, you already drew
the platypus."
700,3639073,3640274,Yeah.
701,3640307,3643110,You know what this is?
702,3643144,3645746,It's a bag of money.
703,3654388,3656257,That's the last one for today.
704,3662930,3666767,"Tell you what,
you draw this,"
705,3666800,3669170,I won't bother you again.
706,3669203,3671839,"You can sit in your chair
all day."
707,3684752,3686120,Come in.
708,3691458,3694361,Hey.
709,3694395,3696397,I brought you some carrots.
710,3698866,3702803,"Hey, you wanna see a picture
that your dad just drew?"
711,3702836,3704471,Yeah.
712,3704506,3705773,This is really good.
713,3707208,3709743,"No, no, no."
714,3709777,3710744,Spit.
715,3711546,3712746,Spit.
716,3712780,3713948,Out!
717,3715416,3716850,Out!
718,3719019,3720287,Ok.
719,3723457,3725092,Ok.
720,3726026,3727428,We don't want him choking.
721,3727461,3728429,There you go.
722,3728462,3731899,"Hey Doc, you mind if I uh,
had a little time?"
723,3731932,3734068,"Sure, of course."
724,3736036,3737838,"You let me know if you
need anything, ok?"
725,3737871,3740741,Cu-cu-cluck.
726,3749984,3751285,Psst.
727,3751318,3752920,Pop.
728,3755022,3757358,You can drop the act now.
729,3765065,3767569,I like your picture.
730,3767602,3769403,"Those yours, too?"
731,3769436,3770572,Eh.
732,3770605,3771939,Can I see 'em?
733,3771972,3773774,Eh.
734,3774408,3775943,What is this?
735,3775976,3779446,Pla... ty... pus...
736,3779480,3780948,It's a platypus?
737,3780981,3783384,Yeah.
738,3783417,3786453,Look at that.
739,3786487,3787488,That's-that's a duck.
740,3788422,3789591,Yeah.
741,3789624,3791825,That's what ducks do.
742,3792560,3794596,Who's this?
743,3794629,3798966,He's got a little balloon.
744,3798999,3801235,That's Tony.
745,3801268,3803871,Who?
746,3803904,3805439,Tony.
747,3805472,3809143,Who's Tony?
748,3809176,3811312,My... son.
749,3815082,3817084,"Your son, Tony?"
750,3820254,3822456,"Pop, what are you
talking about?"
751,3825459,3827227,I'm your son.
752,3834636,3836937,Ehh...
753,3836970,3838606,Nah.
754,3849116,3851218,T- Tony.
755,3862930,3865032,Want another one?
756,3867368,3869002,Yeah.
757,3872306,3873240,Not too much.
758,3873273,3875209,Aah.
759,3929496,3930665,Fonse.
760,3930698,3935603,"Can you put that down so I can
talk to you for a minute?"
761,3935637,3937137,Fonse?
762,3942009,3947615,"I'll always remember,
even when we was kids,"
763,3947649,3955222,you always had it all up here.
764,3955255,3958693,You always hated paper.
765,3958726,3960628,"You didn't trust nobody,
nothin'."
766,3960662,3964465,"Not even your own
fuckin' family."
767,3964498,3970137,"I never took offence
by it or nothin'."
768,3970170,3974308,"I want you to tell me
if you hid anything."
769,3974341,3977745,Like money.
770,3977779,3980582,"I need to know
where the fuck it is."
771,3980615,3983685,"These cocksuckers are gonna
get it either way,"
772,3983718,3986186,so it makes no difference.
773,3990658,3993494,"We got nothing, Fonse,
you understand?"
774,4005740,4008810,"Well, I hope one of our kids has
in him what you had in you"
775,4008843,4011445,because that's our only hope.
776,4016518,4018686,"Everything ok, boss?"
777,4018720,4020755,"Yeah, we're fine. Thanks."
778,4022524,4024324,"If you want my opinion,"
779,4024358,4027762,"Gino and the boys and those
fuckin' Cubans?"
780,4032432,4034602,"They're part of this
whole fuckin' thing."
781,4034636,4037170,They're a bunch of rats.
782,4037204,4039507,That's just my hunch.
783,4039541,4041308,I gotta take a leak.
784,4041341,4045145,"When I come back we'll walk
around the pool, ok?"
785,4116249,4118586,"Who's making you
the most nuts?"
786,4123390,4126728,"You know, I got an idea, ma."
787,4126761,4128428,"I think we can make
a couple bucks."
788,4128462,4131365,Yeah? What's that?
789,4131398,4133233,"I think we should put pops
in the zoo."
790,4135402,4136871,"I mean, hey, we glue some
hair on him,"
791,4136904,4138673,"throw him in with
the monkeys..."
792,4138706,4140240,"it's too easy to picture,
isn't it?"
793,4140273,4140742,"No, it's... stop."
794,4145947,4147515,You see this?
795,4147548,4148716,What is that?
796,4148750,4150384,That is Tony.
797,4150417,4151886,Who's Tony?
798,4151919,4153921,"It's his son, Tony."
799,4161294,4162530,The poor guy.
800,4168770,4170303,"Just to be clear I don't
have some brother"
801,4170337,4172507,"out there named Tony, do I?"
802,4181549,4185753,He was a good father to you.
803,4185787,4187689,He's still here.
804,4189256,4190892,Yeah.
805,4196864,4198432,Take your time.
806,4210712,4212780,"How's it going, Mae?"
807,4212814,4214214,Fonse.
808,4215415,4216450,"Hey, Gino."
809,4216483,4217518,"Hey, Rose."
810,4217552,4219219,"Have a seat, Gino."
811,4220888,4223791,Get some wine.
812,4223825,4225593,Want more?
813,4229396,4231733,"Come on, chew your food."
814,4231766,4233501,Looks good.
815,4252587,4254021,What?
816,4268669,4269570,Oh my god!
817,4269604,4270071,Oh my god!
818,4270104,4270905,Pop!
819,4270938,4271906,Fonse!
820,4271939,4272507,What'd I do?
821,4272540,4273741,"Gino, just go, alright?"
822,4273775,4274675,"Just go, please."
823,4274709,4277011,"Somebody help me get him up
off the floor?"
824,4277044,4277812,Grab the diapers.
825,4277845,4278780,"I got 'em, I got 'em."
826,4278813,4280447,Pop? Pop? You're ok.
827,4280480,4281816,You're ok.
828,4281849,4283785,"Go easy!
You're hurting him."
829,4283818,4285052,"Let's get the chair, please."
830,4285086,4287789,"One, two, three, get him up."
831,4302003,4304505,"Get some rest, pal."
832,4342176,4344846,"Our special Cobb theatre
presentation of"
833,4344879,4347882,"the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre continues."
834,4347915,4349617,"Thursday morning,
Chicago."
835,4349650,4352553,"Johnny and the gang,
disguised as Chicago's finest,"
836,4352587,4355556,"cruising the streets of the south
side in a stolen paddy-wagon."
837,4355590,4356824,Hey! There they are!
838,4356858,4359026,Torrio's guys. Get 'em!
839,4359060,4360493,"You're under arrest, mister."
840,4360528,4361896,Arrest? What for?
841,4361929,4362930,"Quiet, you."
842,4362964,4364699,Put your hands behind your back.
843,4364732,4367568,Don't I know you from somewhere?
844,4369904,4372173,"Torrio's men lined up
against the wall."
845,4372206,4375176,"Someone tell us, officer,
what's this about?"
846,4375209,4377612,"Al Capone sends
his regards."
847,4385519,4387420,Happy Valentine's Day!
848,4390992,4393426,"Sources close to the Chicago
authorities said"
849,4393460,4395162,"only Al Capone kills
like that."
850,4395196,4396731,"How do you comment,
Mr. Capone?"
851,4396764,4398566,"Well, I'll tell you what
Al Capone says."
852,4398599,4401102,"Al Capone is an honest
law-abiding"
853,4401135,4402303,American businessman.
854,4402336,4404739,"The only killing he makes
is in the best of services"
855,4404772,4405706,to millions of...
856,4407241,4408175,"Go on, boys."
857,4408209,4411646,"Me and Johnny got some
private business."
858,4411679,4413147,"Everything alright, boss?"
859,4413180,4415750,"Yeah, beautiful."
860,4415783,4418152,"You know, I've known you
since we was kids, Johnny."
861,4418185,4419654,"That's right, boss."
862,4419687,4421454,"You always been loyal,
Johnny."
863,4422489,4423490,Like a dog.
864,4424491,4425425,Well...
865,4425458,4426861,"That's why it hurts me,
I gotta do this."
866,4426894,4427828,"Do what, Al?"
867,4429764,4430865,You sold me out!
868,4431899,4433634,You sold me out to Torrio!
869,4434669,4435468,To the Feds!
870,4436671,4437705,To the whole-
871,4446881,4449482,They never get it right.
872,4449517,4451484,I never sold no one out.
873,4451519,4452954,You know that.
874,4459794,4462063,I took a little off the top.
875,4462096,4464231,I'm not proud of it.
876,4464265,4465800,You made the right move.
877,4465833,4468703,"I'da done the same thing
if I was you."
878,4471539,4473040,You don't skim.
879,4483117,4487688,"The only thing that
really matters, Fonse,"
880,4487722,4491092,"is how a man treats
his family."
881,4491125,4495730,"You'll always be a hero to every
stiff breakin' his back."
882,4495763,4500835,"Not a lot of goons from Carol
Street could state that claim."
883,4500868,4502970,"You're a good man, Fonse."
884,4507208,4508876,"Don't worry, pal."
885,4508909,4511812,I didn't feel nothin'.
886,4511846,4514648,You took me off the street.
887,4514682,4516917,I'll always respect you.
888,4521856,4526093,"You know, you seem like
a really nice fella."
889,4526127,4533634,"Maybe if ya had some courage
you might be able"
890,4533667,4536570,"to find yourself some
new friends."
891,4546313,4549717,"I think I know where
you buried that money."
892,4563397,4564932,Oh...
893,4569837,4571672,Oh...
894,4583751,4587721,Look in these.
895,4587755,4592960,"They'll help guide you
to the key."
896,4592993,4595329,"I'll see you sometime,
Fonse."
897,4599233,4600701,No!
898,4600734,4603971,"No, no, no!"
899,4604004,4605372,What was that screamin'?
900,4605406,4606640,"Oh my god,
let him be ok."
901,4606674,4608175,"- Fonse, we're coming!
- Fonse!"
902,4608209,4609243,What the hell's going on?
903,4611745,4612813,What's wrong?
904,4612847,4614081,No!
905,4614115,4615216,"- No!
- What's wrong?"
906,4615249,4615983,Fonse!
907,4616016,4616917,Shhh.
908,4616951,4617885,No!
909,4617918,4619153,No!
910,4619186,4620754,What is that?!
911,4622256,4623190,There's nothing there.
912,4623224,4623958,Hey! Hey!
913,4623991,4625126,"Hey, hey, hey!"
914,4625159,4626827,That's disgusting!
915,4626861,4627795,No!
916,4627828,4628996,No!
917,4629029,4630731,No!
918,4645179,4649817,"About 22, 23 years ago
I was in Minneapolis."
919,4649850,4655322,"I was your age, sitting on this
old accountant, Jewish guy."
920,4655356,4657691,"Supposed to be some
big laundering conduit"
921,4657725,4658459,in the mid-west.
922,4658492,4659693,"Anyway, I'm sitting
on my ass."
923,4659727,4660694,"Two years, nothing."
924,4660728,4661630,"Three years, nothing."
925,4661662,4663264,"So, you know, I tell 'em
back in New York,"
926,4663297,4667034,"fellas, there's nothing here."
927,4667067,4671038,"Hoover says to me ""Nordhoff,
you're-you're looking"
928,4671071,4675476,"""but you're not thinking.""
Ok?"
929,4675510,4677378,"Four years, I'm looking,
I'm thinking."
930,4677411,4679079,Five years.
931,4679113,4681282,Guess what happened?
932,4681315,4682183,What?
933,4682216,4683484,My dick froze off.
934,4683518,4684118,It's true.
935,4684151,4686353,Be glad you're in Florida.
936,4686387,4687454,I got something for you.
937,4687488,4688322,He's dead.
938,4688355,4689156,No.
939,4689190,4690257,Alright.
940,4690291,4691759,"He's been saying a lot of
very interesting things."
941,4691792,4693894,"Sure, he has
full-blown dementia."
942,4693928,4695963,"I think I kind of owe it to
a 20-year investigation"
943,4695996,4698199,"to look in his eyes and know
for sure before he's gone."
944,4698232,4702002,"I don't know how to break
this to you, son."
945,4702036,4706440,"I don't give a shit
about Al Capone."
946,4706473,4707141,I don't.
947,4707174,4708809,"He dies, we dig his place up,"
948,4708842,4710844,"find whatever's there
and move on."
949,4710878,4712079,"Do you know what
the difference is, sir,"
950,4712112,4715316,"between Adolf Hitler
and Al Capone?"
951,4715349,4717785,Hitler's dead.
952,4717818,4720487,"Capone lives like a king
in Florida."
953,4720522,4723991,"Maybe he's crazy,
maybe he's not."
954,4724024,4726160,"All I know is a man who spends
his entire life lying"
955,4726193,4734435,"to everyone about everything,
the truth rots in there."
956,4734468,4739106,"Let's catch some of his marbles
on the way out."
957,4739139,4740307,I gotta make a call.
958,4740341,4742343,The lawyer's paying.
959,4742376,4745513,"Just don't make me
look stupid, huh, kid?"
960,4745547,4747214,"Thank you, Mr. Nordhoff."
961,4747248,4748215,Yeah.
962,4768369,4770070,Mr. Mattingly.
963,4770104,4771238,Good morning.
964,4778879,4780214,"This is Agent
Stirling H. Crawford"
965,4780247,4782049,"of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation."
966,4782082,4784952,"Present with me is my colleague,
Agent Clifford M. Harris,"
967,4784985,4787421,"and we are here at the residence
of Mr. Alfonse Capone"
968,4787454,4789290,"in Palm Island, Florida."
969,4789323,4791125,"In attendance is
Mr. Alfonse Capone"
970,4791158,4794529,"and his legal representative,
Mr. Harold V. Mattingly."
971,4794562,4795630,"The following interview
will be recorded"
972,4795664,4799199,"for the investigative records
relating to case P51B."
973,4799233,4800467,"Mr. Capone, anything you say"
974,4800502,4802970,"can be used against you
or anyone you mention"
975,4803003,4805139,"in your statements
by the federal courts."
976,4805172,4807174,"Do you agree to the conditions
of this interview?"
977,4807207,4808342,Yeah.
978,4808375,4809343,Ok.
979,4809376,4811145,"So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state"
980,4811178,4813981,"your name, age, and your
place of birth?"
981,4814014,4814848,Eh?
982,4814882,4818052,"Go ahead, Fonse."
983,4818085,4821455,"Your name, age, and
your place of birth."
984,4827161,4828228,"My client may have
some difficulty"
985,4828262,4829363,answering for himself.
986,4829396,4831965,"If requested by my client
I'll answer on his behalf."
987,4831999,4833967,"We understand that, of course."
988,4834001,4835570,"We'd appreciate the
opportunity for Mr. Capone"
989,4835603,4837572,"to at least try to answer
our questions"
990,4837605,4839840,to the best of his ability.
991,4842142,4843177,Knock yourself out.
992,4843210,4844411,Thank you.
993,4844445,4846380,"So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state"
994,4846413,4849450,"your name, age,
and place of birth?"
995,4854154,4857157,"On behalf of my client,
his name is Alfonse Capone,"
996,4857191,4861295,"C-A-P-O-N-E, born
January 17th, 1899,"
997,4861328,4862630,"Brooklyn, New York."
998,4862664,4865999,"Mr. Capone, prior to your
incarceration in California in 1931"
999,4866033,4870971,"did you keep any financial
records in your possession?"
1000,4872172,4874576,"On behalf of my client, no."
1001,4874609,4876544,"He kept no information
of that kind."
1002,4876578,4878178,"So we understand it that
you have been ill now"
1003,4878212,4879681,for quite some time.
1004,4879714,4881348,Yeah.
1005,4881382,4884385,"In fact I have here that you
originally contracted syphilis"
1006,4884418,4887454,"while you were under the age
of 15 years old."
1007,4887488,4888922,Is that correct?
1008,4888956,4890924,"Yes, per his medical records."
1009,4890958,4893360,"Mr. Capone, were you or were
you not defacto chief"
1010,4893394,4895462,"of the Chicago Outfit
Criminal Organization"
1011,4895496,4897931,"which presided over the illicit
sale of liquor products"
1012,4897965,4901368,"during the nationwide ban
prior to its lift in 1933?"
1013,4901402,4902336,Nope.
1014,4902369,4903303,"On behalf of my client, nope."
1015,4903337,4904104,No.
1016,4904138,4904672,Right.
1017,4904706,4906608,Ok.
1018,4906641,4908610,"- Turn that off.
- Got it."
1019,4908643,4911111,I'd like to apologize.
1020,4911145,4913347,"Mr. Mattingly, I am sorry."
1021,4913380,4914381,Harris-
1022,4914415,4916350,"What's this about, Crawford?"
1023,4916383,4918485,"We have information that your
client may have tucked away"
1024,4918520,4921523,a very large sum of money.
1025,4921556,4924992,About $10 million.
1026,4925025,4926326,I know nothing of this.
1027,4926360,4928295,"Well, I think your client does."
1028,4928328,4932700,"Mr. Capone, can you tell me
where you hid that money?"
1029,4932734,4935068,Oh.
1030,4935102,4938205,Hmm.
1031,4938238,4940174,"I'm talking to you, Al."
1032,4942476,4943511,Yeah.
1033,4943545,4944512,Where's the money?
1034,4944546,4946947,Yeah.
1035,4947214,4949283,"Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Capone."
1036,4949316,4951452,"While I personally believe
that you deserve every ounce"
1037,4951485,4953420,"of torture and everlasting
despair"
1038,4953454,4955590,"that awaits you
in the next life,"
1039,4955623,4957157,"your family has done nothing
to deserve"
1040,4957191,4958693,"what's coming to them
in this one."
1041,4958726,4960060,No prominent jobs-
1042,4960093,4961295,This is harassment.
1043,4961328,4963665,"No decent education so long
as their last name is Capone."
1044,4963698,4965199,"Other than this pile
of cement here"
1045,4965232,4966501,"they're gonna be left
with nothing of your legacy."
1046,4966534,4967468,Hey!
1047,4967502,4968703,"Only a penniless, bitter
life of alienation."
1048,4968736,4969504,Crawford!
1049,4969537,4971506,"No new friends,
no new beginnings."
1050,4971539,4974475,And we will watch them.
1051,4974509,4976778,"Every single day
until the day they die,"
1052,4976811,4978111,just like you.
1053,4984485,4986186,Oh.
1054,4991124,4993661,Oh.
1055,4993695,4996129,"Ok, gentlemen."
1056,4996163,4997498,"Oh, no."
1057,4997532,5000602,"My client has no idea
what's going on"
1058,5000635,5005305,"or what he ate this morning, or
anything else you wanna ask him."
1059,5005339,5007575,"Have we had enough pestering
for one day?"
1060,5009611,5011245,Is this what you wanted?
1061,5011278,5014481,"Thank you, Mr. Mattingly,
thank you."
1062,5014516,5017184,"We'll be seeing you,
Mr. Capone."
1063,5026393,5029062,Yeah?
1064,5029096,5030698,"Collect call
from Cleveland."
1065,5032099,5033835,Yeah.
1066,5036203,5037672,Hello?
1067,5041743,5043477,Hello?
1068,5044812,5047414,I'm not gonna hang up.
1069,5047447,5049383,Hello?
1070,5049416,5050552,"Ok, I am gonna hang up."
1071,5050585,5052185,Is this Mae?
1072,5053588,5055122,Hello?
1073,5061194,5063263,Who is this?
1074,5064699,5066834,Is this Tony?
1075,5077579,5078646,Mae!
1076,5080648,5081849,Mae!
1077,5081883,5083818,What?
1078,5083851,5086688,You seen Fonse?
1079,5086721,5089189,No.
