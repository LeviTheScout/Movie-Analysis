you are so good with nunchucks,"

146,611110,614568,I am just severely cross-eyed.
147,614680,616648,"I know, it is weird."
148,617717,619014,Be seated.
149,631430,633261,"Deepak, here you go."
150,639538,643099,"Maurice, you're not of Indian blood."
151,644210,645734,Speak of your parents.
152,645845,649076,"They are both dead.
They were missionaries."
153,649181,651672,And what did they do before then?
154,651784,654048,They were dog stylists.
155,654153,656485,"So, let me get this straight."
156,656589,660719,"They were into doggy style
before the missionary position?"
157,664597,667566,"That's hilarious.
My parents are dead. Thanks."
158,668601,669863,"Deepak,"
159,669969,673598,"why do you want to join
the Tugginmypudha Ashram?"
160,673706,675571,To seek my true self.
161,675675,677643,"All right, kiss ass."
162,678844,682177,"Maurice, why do you want to join?"
163,682281,685375,"I want to become a guru
so girls will like me."
164,685484,687452,Then I will like myself.
165,688754,692622,"Deepak, you will enjoy love in all forms."
166,692725,695660,"Maurice, you must
wear this chastity belt."
167,699098,701828,Chastity belt? That sucks!
168,701934,703367,Once you have learned
169,703469,707701,"that self-love is more important
than being loved by others,"
170,707807,709206,you may remove the belt.
171,709308,714575,"Master, if I am not allowed
to be with a woman, may I still..."
172,716716,718581,You will go cross-eyed!
173,720653,721984,Guaranteed.

181,758991,760288,Okay.
182,760392,763953,"If I sit like this any longer,
I'm gonna pop my dink bag."
183,764597,767430,Listen up. I am a guru.
184,767533,769763,"Let's look at the word ""guru,"" okay?"
185,769869,774465,"My goal is to get you to say,
""Gee, you are you."""
186,776075,777474,TM.
187,777610,781910,"And the you of ""guru"" is intimacy."
188,782014,784073,"Or ""into-me-l-see."""
189,784183,785548,I see.
190,785651,788119,"Without intimacy, you feel nowhere."

from nowhere to ""now here."""

195,804403,805665,"- Nowhere.
- Nowhere."
196,806872,810433,"My laws of intimacy
are kind of like my Bible."

265,1096962,1098520,"No, I am good."
266,1098630,1100621,Who is this prick?
267,1100732,1103462,"Well, how do you do? Shrimp?"
268,1104503,1106130,"What'd you call me, Jagamo?"
269,1106238,1109002,"I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your gnome... Name!"
270,1110109,1111736,You are a midget.
271,1112544,1114671,I find that term condescending!
272,1114780,1118443,"Condescending.
That's a big word for you."
273,1119818,1121115,The man's an ass!
274,1121220,1124314,"Your Holiness, you're an expert on love."
275,1124423,1125447,"Yes, I am."
276,1125557,1128526,"Why do you think Darren Roanoke
threw away his marriage?"
277,1128627,1132222,"Well, in my book,
I Know You Are, But What Am I?"
278,1132331,1134356,I explain that when love goes wrong...
279,1134466,1136058,"- Nothing goes right.
...nothing goes right."
280,1136168,1138762,"- Yes!
- I've read it. It's impressive."
281,1138871,1141305,"Yeah, it's nothing short
of a masterpiece."
282,1141406,1144603,"So, do you think you can come back
with us to Toronto in the team jet?"
283,1144710,1147201,"- It's a date.
- Is it, now?"
284,1147312,1151009,"Well, this kitten's got a whip. Meow!"
285,1154353,1156583,"This is great, Your Holiness!"
286,1156688,1161057,"I can see you now,
spreading your message of self-love"
287,1161160,1163151,"- on Oprah.
- Oprah!"
288,1163262,1165560,"He's finally here for the first time
on the Oprah show."
289,1165664,1167859,Welcome Guru Pitka.
290,1171803,1175739,"Oprah! Come on, Oprah."
291,1181547,1184573,Hello. Thank you very much.
292,1185751,1189619,"Mariska Hargitay.
Thank you for the gift of water."
293,1189721,1192155,"All right, I'm just gonna
come out and say it."
294,1192257,1194919,I find your work really inspiring.
295,1195027,1198986,"I actually went to one of your sutras
after my father passed away."
296,1199097,1201759,I'm sorry to hear about your father.
297,1201900,1204095,"Have you read my book
on the grieving process?"
298,1204203,1207502,"It's called, What's This?
A Dead One of These."
299,1209141,1211006,"- Yes.
- Oh, you have?"
300,1211109,1215671,"I especially like the chapter,
""It Might Just Be Sleeping."""
301,1215781,1217544,My favorite.
302,1217649,1220083,"- I've read all your books.
- Oh. Well."
303,1220185,1224019,"To tell you the truth,
I kind of have a schoolgirl crush."
304,1225057,1226422,"Oh, really?"
305,1227492,1230393,"What does your husband
think about this crush?"
306,1230495,1232725,I'm not married.
307,1232831,1234765,"- Boyfriend?
- Nope."
308,1236735,1238066,Girlfriend?
309,1239571,1241766,"Well, I mean,
there was one time in college."
310,1241873,1243636,Really?
311,1243742,1246438,"- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything."
312,1249915,1252713,"Well, it's hard to believe a girl like you
can't find a man."
313,1252818,1254342,"What does that mean, ""a girl like me""?"
314,1254453,1256478,"Well, come on, I don't have words for it."
315,1256588,1261548,"You know, nice girl, intelligent,"
316,1261660,1267428,"bedroom eyes, pouty lips, great rack,
tight bell-shaped ass,"
317,1267532,1268760,thicker than a Snicker...
318,1270369,1271336,Say.
319,1272571,1275768,"My problem with men
is the Bullard Curse."
320,1275874,1277671,What's a Bullard Curse?
321,1277776,1282975,"My father, Hank Bullard,
bought the Leafs in 1967."
322,1283315,1285715,"And we haven't
won a Stanley Cup since."
323,1285817,1288813,"So, all the men in the city
blame me and my family."
324,1288920,1292583,"Well, as I write in my book
Stop Hitting Yourself."
325,1292691,1294591,Stop Hitting Yourself.
326,1294693,1297389,Why Are You Still Hitting Yourself?
327,1297496,1301489,"I explain that,
people may say bad things about you,"
328,1302668,1305865,"but you must never
say bad things about yourself."
329,1308473,1311704,I see someone who's ready for change.
330,1311810,1313744,"It would just be easier to change,"
331,1313845,1316439,"if I didn't have to deal with the city
that hates me."
332,1316548,1319381,"Jane, the City of Toronto
doesn't hate you."
333,1319484,1321315,"- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't."
334,1321420,1323047,"- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't."
335,1323155,1324213,Trust me.
336,1324323,1326188,"At the arena,
I had Maintenance paint lines"
337,1326291,1327758,"to show me
where the crowd can't see me."
338,1332631,1338467,"You know, so they don't boo me
and throw stuff at my head."
339,1341506,1345442,"I mean, I didn't even ask for this job!
I guess it's just my fate!"
340,1345544,1347136,Fate is a joke.
341,1347245,1351739,"And as I once read on a wall,
in a truck stop bathroom in Barstow,"
342,1351850,1355115,"""The joke is in your hands."""
343,1358056,1360149,"Oh, my God, I just got that!"
344,1361693,1365459,"Well, to be more accurate,
the joke was in Rajneesh's hands."
345,1368834,1369801,What?
346,1383048,1384515,Nice shooting!
347,1386318,1389082,"I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka."
348,1389187,1390814,"Look, man,
just get back on your pillow, all right?"
349,1390922,1393356,"There ain't no connection
between my love life and my hockey."
350,1393458,1395085,I'm not here to work with you.
351,1395193,1398060,I just came by to say hello and goodbye.
352,1398163,1399562,"- Goodbye?
- Yeah."
353,1399664,1401529,"I spoke with your wife, Prudence."
354,1401666,1405727,"She broke it off with Grande,
and now she wants you back!"
355,1405837,1408772,"- Seriously?
- Sure. You don't need me."
356,1408907,1411137,Go back to what you were doing.
357,1420118,1421142,Yes!
358,1421253,1423721,There is one other thing.
359,1423822,1425050,I lied.
360,1425157,1426590,"Prudence is still with Jacques Grande,"
361,1426691,1429717,"and he still has
the biggest wiener in hockey."
362,1433765,1437166,"- Is it true?
- Yes, he has a ginormous hog."
363,1437269,1440102,Do you still think there is no connection
364,1440238,1443571,"between Prudence
and how crappy you are playing?"
365,1443675,1444972,Tell me this.
366,1445076,1447010,"- Do you want Prudence back?
- Of course I do."
367,1447112,1450013,"Then I need you
to write Prudence an apology letter,"
368,1450115,1452447,and I will go deliver it to her.
369,1452584,1454848,All bids for connection count.
370,1456888,1460585,"- What if it doesn't work?
- I can always refund your misery."
371,1463228,1465162,I was ominous just then.
372,1483782,1486444,"Grande's not going to like you
talking to Prudence."
373,1486585,1489782,"I know, but I must deliver
this apology letter to her."
374,1489888,1493551,"- Do you think Grande saw us?
- Of course not, Rajneesh."
375,1493658,1496286,We are completely hidden by this bush.
376,1499464,1502627,This may go badly.
377,1503869,1505928,Keep the elephant running.
378,1510175,1511403,Prudence?
379,1513678,1515305,My little cabbage?
380,1524623,1526250,"While I do your calves,
I'd like to sing a song"
381,1526358,1532160,"by the greatest singer ever
from Quebec, Miss Celine Dion."
382,1533398,1537198,You were my strength when I was weak
383,1537302,1541261,"You were my voice
when I couldn't speak"
384,1541373,1543238,You were my eyes when I...
385,1550749,1554617,You saw the best there was in me
386,1558089,1559056,No!
387,1559157,1560920,You were my eye...
388,1562460,1565054,"Do not peck my fucking eyes!
Don't peck my eyes!"
389,1565163,1569031,Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
390,1569134,1573764,You gave me faith 'cause you believed
391,1573872,1577239,I'm everything I am
392,1577342,1579936,Because you love me
393,1580078,1581443,That was beautiful.
394,1581546,1587348,"And now, I'd like to show my love
by making for you a Quebec pizza."
395,1587452,1590478,"- What's that?
- Pop-Tart with the ketchup."
396,1590589,1591954,She's good.
397,1595827,1599160,Guru Pitka? What happened to you?
398,1601866,1604562,Nothing. Why do you ask?
399,1607472,1611465,"We've not much time.
I have an apology letter from Darren."
400,1613545,1617777,"Well, you know, I got attacked
by a rooster. So, you know."
401,1617882,1619349,Yeah.
402,1619451,1622443,"So he writes one stupid note
and you expect me to take him back?"
403,1622554,1624954,"- Perhaps I can change him.
- Ding-dong."
404,1625090,1628924,"Did someone order
the special Quebec pizza, eh?"
405,1629060,1631119,"You know, like in the porno."
406,1632530,1635431,"- Who is this in my house?
- Whoa!"
407,1638403,1641531,Looks like he's smuggling a schnauzer.
408,1641640,1642732,Yeah.
409,1643675,1644869,Let me show you out.
410,1644976,1646204,"Down, boy."
411,1647178,1648805,Read the letter.
412,1652450,1653849,"- Nice place, eh?
- Yeah."
413,1653952,1655715,And I got her cheap.
414,1655820,1659153,"So, it's an honor to have you
here in my house, Guru Pitka."
415,1659257,1661384,"I think you are an amazing guru, and..."
416,1661493,1662790,Hey! Mister!
417,1663762,1666424,What did you do to my rooster?
418,1666865,1669493,I don't know what you're talking about.
419,1671770,1673931,Stay away from my girlfriend!
420,1678309,1679867,The Wolverine.
421,1692857,1696793,"Don't look at me with that tone of voice,
or I punch you in the shirt!"
422,1696895,1698385,"Okay, gotta go."
423,1700198,1701790,Beat it. I gotta take a dump.
424,1701900,1703424,Bodhisattva!
425,1708473,1713708,"Hello, superstar.
Welcome to my new Toronto ashram."
426,1713812,1715143,Uncle Jack.
427,1715246,1716804,"Can I get a hand
getting off this elephant?"
428,1716915,1720681,"Darren, if your Uncle Jack
helped you off an elephant,"
429,1720785,1723811,"would you help your Uncle
Jack off an elephant?"
430,1727025,1728754,That's funny to you?
431,1729828,1731921,I don't know where I get it.
432,1732030,1734294,"So did you give Prudence
my apology letter or what?"
433,1734399,1737095,"- Yes, of course!
- Did it work?"
434,1737202,1739295,Let me answer it this way.
435,1743374,1745604,"- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am!"
436,1752484,1755453,"Now, your entourage must stay behind."
437,1755587,1757350,"No, no, no, no, no. They protect me."
438,1757455,1760982,"Well, they didn't protect you
from that outfit, now, did they?"
439,1761092,1762616,What?
440,1762727,1764285,What's wrong with shark skin?
441,1764395,1767330,"More like gay-skin, how about.
What? Yeah."
442,1769501,1770627,Snaps.
443,1772170,1776197,"- Right, let's talk about Jacques Grande!
- No! Leave that man out of this."
444,1776307,1777501,"You feel inadequate,"
445,1777609,1783104,"because he has plenty of clarity,
organization, charm, and knowledge."
446,1783214,1784272,TM.
447,1786050,1788985,"Yeah, he's got a lot of that, all right."
448,1789087,1791851,"Therefore, he's able to say to Prudence,"
449,1791956,1795687,"""Be loving and open-hearted
with my emotions."""
450,1796961,1798121,TM.
451,1799430,1801159,You better stop right there.
452,1801266,1805066,"Blowme is a good way
to remember that. Blowme, yeah."
453,1805170,1808571,"Blowme, yeah. Blowme."
454,1808673,1809833,Blowme.
455,1810642,1813907,"- You should stop.
- Well, I'm sure you're sick of this."
456,1814045,1816775,"I know Prudence
has had it up to here with Grande."
457,1816881,1818849,"All right, you know what?"
458,1823688,1825212,I can't move my body!

508,1992290,1993689,"Thanks, Jay."
509,1994492,1996187,"All right, guys. Bring it in."
510,1996294,1999457,"Let's rip off their heads
and shit down their necks!"
511,1999564,2000861,Yeah!
512,2000965,2003024,"- Go! Go!
- Here we go!"
513,2003134,2006103,"Now, the first lesson is distraction."
514,2006204,2007728,"In order to learn distraction,"
515,2007839,2010569,"you're not allowed to fight anyone
in today's hockey match."
516,2010675,2011642,I'm a hockey player!
517,2011743,2013005,"That's what hockey players do.
We fight!"
518,2013111,2014408,It's a problem.
519,2014512,2019074,"Even Jay-Z had 99 of them,
and the bitch was not one of them."
520,2019884,2022682,"Now, do you want to win Stanley's Cup?"
521,2022787,2025085,"Yes, I wanna win the Stanley Cup!"
522,2025189,2028522,"Then you are not allowed
to fight anyone for any reason!"
523,2031696,2034893,"Don't fight!
Now, get out there, and don't kill them."
524,2039170,2040899,"- What is that?
- Corn dog."
525,2041939,2043065,What is it?
526,2043174,2045369,Is it made from dog?
527,2045476,2047376,What a freaking idiot.
528,2048946,2051540,"Is this a dog's thingy?
Am I being punk'd?"
529,2052917,2056444,"Ladies and gentlemen,
the Leafs take the ice."
530,2066798,2069062,"Hello, Los Angeles Kings."
531,2069167,2071260,"I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka."
532,2071369,2074065,"And I have a message
from Darren Roanoke."
533,2074172,2078666,"He told me to tell you
that you're all his bitches,"
534,2079677,2082373,and that you can suck his big greasy...
535,2084949,2086541,Mariska Hargitay.
536,2091789,2094849,"- I'm gonna kill you, Roanoke!
- You're dead, Roanoke!"
537,2094959,2095983,"Damn, Roanoke!"
538,2096094,2100053,"And we're getting ready to drop the
puck for game one of the Finals."
539,2100164,2104533,"- I know I'm excited, Jay. How are you?
- I am rigid."
540,2115913,2117744,It's a yard sale!
541,2120151,2122381,"- What?
- Not to fight."
542,2122487,2124616,You are not to fight anyone.
543,2138636,2141332,I would not wanna be his nutsack.
544,2142006,2144668,They're coming after Roanoke!
545,2150148,2151308,Get up!
546,2155219,2156481,What the hell are you doing?
547,2156587,2159613,"Superstar, look at your hands."
548,2160658,2162888,"- They're not shaking!
- Yes."
549,2165696,2168392,Roanoke with the puck. What a pass!
550,2169333,2170425,Goal!
551,2170535,2174801,"Roanoke may be fighting for his life,
but he's playing great!"
552,2181445,2185814,"Rob Blake is lucky
the refs didn't see that."
553,2185917,2188909,"But the refs will see that
on our post-game highlight reel."
554,2189020,2193855,"That is the Altoids "" Curiously Strong
Elbow to the Face"" of the game."
555,2193958,2196552,"Oh, God. Am I still dreaming?"
556,2197962,2200089,No. Why do you ask?
557,2202166,2203360,Why'd you tell me not to fight?
558,2203467,2207062,"Because you are now distracted,
therefore playing better."
559,2207171,2208604,It's the only way.
560,2208706,2210037,"Yeah, well,
I can't keep getting my ass kicked!"
561,2210141,2213702,Fine! Fight anyone for any reason.
562,2213811,2215369,You just said don't fight...
563,2215479,2218676,"- What, it's just arbitrary with you?
- Of course not!"
564,2218783,2221081,But we will let the dice decide.
565,2223154,2226646,"Yes, it is arbitrary!
Fight anyone for any reason!"
566,2232263,2233696,Fight anyone.
567,2241772,2244002,It's a bench-clearing brawl!
568,2245443,2247604,"Remember, kids, this is not
how you play hockey."
569,2247712,2249976,"- It's just ugly.
- I like it."
570,2256787,2258152,That was a good one.
571,2260825,2263020,"One game suspension, Roanoke!"
572,2263127,2265493,"Way to go, Roanoke! You jag-off!"
573,2267365,2271461,"- Him, too?
- Anyone for any reason."
574,2277375,2280208,I love my job!
575,2281846,2284747,"- Two games!
- Now, it's a two-game suspension."
576,2284849,2288478,"That would mean Roanoke
would be out for game two and three!"
577,2288586,2290053,He could play in game four.
578,2290154,2292452,"Of course, we don't know
if we're going to game five!"
579,2292556,2295116,"Two and three, out,
can't play in the game."
580,2295226,2297490,"He could watch the game at home,
but he can't play!"
581,2297595,2300029,"He can pretend to play
while he's at home,"
582,2300131,2305125,"but he cannot play on the ice
in the game that we're watching,"
583,2305236,2308672,"which is after this game,
'cause we're in game one."
584,2308773,2311401,You have a firm grasp of the obvious.
585,2314412,2315936,How could he do that?
586,2319183,2320810,Are you all right?
587,2322920,2327414,"I'd like to thank the Academy.
Wow, these things are heavy. Yeah."
588,2327558,2329423,"- Put me down, A-hole!
- Okay."
589,2331429,2335388,"And the Kings take the first game
of the Stanley Cup Finals."
590,2336934,2338128,Damn it!
591,2338836,2340827,"Cherkov, relax!"
592,2340938,2343566,"- Now, everyone, let's just take a seat.
- Okay."
593,2351215,2355447,"First of all, let's agree next time
we decide to have a group meeting,"
594,2355553,2357544,we take it in my office.
595,2359190,2362455,"Now, Guru Pitka here
obviously has a plan."
596,2362560,2366360,"So, Guru, enlighten us.
What is your plan?"
597,2366464,2370059,"Frankly, this is completely unexpected,
and I'm scared shitless."
598,2370167,2371657,"- No, no!
- Let me at him!"
599,2371769,2374499,"- Take it easy, Frodo.
- No! Get back! No!"
600,2375439,2376736,No! No!
601,2377541,2379065,Hippie queer!
602,2379176,2381508,"- Throw a hex on you.
- Okay, okay."
603,2381612,2385173,"Isn't there any way
that you could skip a step or two?"
604,2385282,2388217,"No way!
With Drama, there is no shortcuts."
605,2388319,2390947,"We must now
take him back to his childhood."
606,2391055,2393387,"- His childhood?
- Yes."
607,2393491,2395482,"His mother only lives an hour away,"
608,2395593,2397720,"but he won't allow her
to go to the games."
609,2397828,2399227,Interesting.
610,2399697,2402666,"He won't allow his mother
to come to any of his games!"
611,2402767,2405634,"Come, Rajneesh, a breakthrough!"
612,2405736,2407465,"Little help, please!"
613,2410808,2412207,Okay. All right.
614,2412743,2414802,"- You're leaving?
- Yes."
615,2414912,2417938,"- Where are you going?
- To see Darren."
616,2418048,2420881,"Jane, I promise you,
everything will be fine."
617,2420985,2423249,"Come by my ashram, then I will explain."
618,2423354,2425049,"Coach Cherkov, I would invite you,"
619,2425156,2428683,"but I know you have your meeting
with the Lollipop Guild."
620,2435297,2437663,"Why won't you let your mother come to
any of your hockey games?"
621,2437766,2439199,"'Cause, man,
I don't play well around her, man."
622,2439301,2440495,She freaks me out.
623,2440602,2443070,Then tomorrow we will go to her!
624,2443171,2446629,"- Oh, hell no! Oh, hell no!
- Oh, hells yes!"
625,2460188,2461849,"- Yeah.
- This ain't Driving Miss Daisy, man."
626,2461957,2463891,I'll break your fingers.
627,2474202,2475760,"Okay. Yo, this my street right here."
628,2475871,2477429,"- Tonawanda Street.
- Tonawanda Street?"
629,2477539,2478733,I know this street.
630,2478840,2480535,"- You do?
- Yes."
631,2480642,2483941,"- At what number did you live?
- Fifty-three."
632,2484045,2486570,Do you know a Dickie Withers at 85?
633,2486681,2488080,"- No.
- Well, it does."
634,2489117,2492553,"A dickie does wither at 85.
I own you! Yeah!"
635,2492654,2494451,Yeah! You are laughing!
636,2494589,2497990,"You see, you're filled with joy of a child!"
637,2498093,2500584,You are now ready to meet your ma.
638,2504699,2507167,"I'm warning you, GP, my mom's tough."
639,2507269,2509669,"Oh, please. How bad can she be?"
640,2510138,2512800,Raise it up and make a joyful noise
641,2512908,2515604,"Oh, I shall not be moved"
642,2515710,2519305,"- No, no, no, no
- No, I shall not be moved"
643,2519414,2520381,"No, no"
644,2520482,2524043,Lead me to your rock
645,2524152,2526780,Where I shall not be
646,2526888,2532087,I shall not be moved
647,2532894,2535624,"Remember, Darren,
you must stand up to her."
648,2535730,2536754,Got it.
649,2536865,2539197,"- Baby boy.
- Oh, Mom."
650,2540669,2543103,"Now, why won't you let your ma
come see you play?"
651,2543205,2545799,"It's just that you're not always
the most supportive, Ma."
652,2545907,2547397,Supportive?
653,2550045,2551945,Pressure makes diamonds.
654,2552047,2554106,Pressure also makes rubble.
655,2556117,2559917,"And after a good whipping,
cream rises to the top."
656,2560021,2561511,So does scum!
657,2563792,2566989,"- You're the Guru Pitka.
- Yes, I am."
658,2567095,2569461,"You're like
the poor man's Deepak Chopra."
659,2569564,2570758,Game over.
660,2570865,2574596,"- Oh, Mom, don't, don't.
- Do you have something to say to me?"
661,2575370,2577838,"Yes, you do. Yes, go ahead."
662,2581743,2582767,Yes.
663,2584779,2588180,"You change your hair color?
'Cause it looks nice."
664,2588283,2590114,We'll talk in the car.
665,2591486,2593511,"Well, this was fun."
666,2593622,2597080,"And by fun, of course
I mean emotionally scarring."
667,2597192,2601026,"I know you are not trying to tell me
how to raise my child."
668,2601129,2602460,Gotta go.
669,2603765,2606461,"- Superstar! Superstar, wait!
- Whoa!"
670,2606568,2611437,"Look at you. You're jumpy.
You're like prison bitch jumpy."
671,2611539,2612801,"I told you that
we shouldn't have come here."
672,2612907,2613896,"No, no, no, no, no."
673,2614009,2616034,"We have to go back in there
and confront your mother."
674,2616144,2618169,There has to be another way.
675,2618280,2620771,"Well, I hear you rappin'
Sister McCrappin'."
676,2620882,2623680,"Okay, there are two ways
to regress you."
677,2623785,2625582,"One involves your mother,
your shame core,"
678,2625687,2628485,"and a grueling process
of intense self-examination."
679,2628590,2629989,"- What's the other way?
- Well..."
680,2630759,2632750,What does this sound like?
681,2651379,2654075,"I am making diarrhea sounds
with my cup."
682,2654182,2655911,I'm regressing you.
683,2657752,2660653,Someone's in here. Someone's in here!
684,2664759,2666488,Yes. You are laughing!
685,2666628,2668493,"Why am I laughing, man?"
686,2669164,2671428,Look what you did to my jacket.
687,2672367,2673493,Ball-gazer!
688,2674135,2675534,Go ahead!
689,2676204,2679230,"You bastard.
You totally caught me in a ball-gaze."
690,2679341,2682367,"Congratulations,
you have been regressed."
691,2682477,2683842,I own you!
692,2683945,2686379,"- Yes, you own me.
- That was easy."
693,2686481,2688949,"But with ownership
comes responsibility."
694,2689050,2690608,It was at this point that I realized
695,2690752,2694119,"that my student
was finally shedding his defenses."
696,2694222,2695314,What are you doing?
697,2695457,2697584,He said while eating a chicken wing.
698,2697692,2700490,I am talking into my voice-over machine.
699,2700595,2704531,"So, the Leafs lose game two
by a whopping six-to-one score."
700,2704632,2707726,The Leafs look rattled without Roanoke.
701,2709371,2712966,"- It's Darren Roanoke.
- You mean Roan-choke more like."
702,2715677,2717440,That's great. Nice hat.
703,2717545,2719376,"- I had a hat like that once.
- Yeah?"
704,2719481,2721711,Then my mom got a job.
705,2724652,2727621,"Looks like I'm gonna have to shove
these love beads someplace special."
706,2727722,2728711,You got a problem?
707,2728823,2731792,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me handle this."
708,2731893,2736421,"There are two things about violence
they teach you when becoming a guru."
709,2736531,2737930,"The first thing is,"
710,2738032,2741968,an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.
711,2742070,2743765,"The second thing is,"
712,2743872,2747308,never ever watch the bottle.
713,2762624,2764592,You son of a bitch!
714,2765727,2767456,It's a bar fight!
715,2793655,2795748,"Down, down!"
716,2795857,2797620,Watch out!
717,2797725,2799124,"- Well done!
- Nice job!"
718,2817779,2819747,"Hold on, hold on."
719,2829724,2831692,Niagara Falls is amazing.
720,2832594,2833754,Darren.
721,2833862,2835955,"Just because
your mother only loved you"
722,2836064,2837827,when you achieved
723,2837932,2841163,"doesn't mean that Prudence will
only love you when you achieve."
724,2841269,2842896,"I was afraid
that Prudence would leave me"
725,2843004,2845632,"if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,"
726,2845740,2848538,"- so I left Prudence first.
- That's it!"
727,2848643,2852010,"However, we must
confront your mother."
728,2852146,2854307,"Prudence always wanted me
to stand up to my ma."
729,2854415,2856440,"- I know.
- I miss Prudence."
730,2857318,2859843,I miss the connection.
731,2859954,2861819,"- Connection.
- Yeah."
732,2862457,2866120,"Making love.
Falling asleep in each other's arms."
733,2866227,2868320,"Sometimes we would wake up
a couple hours later,"
734,2868429,2870829,"and it'd be like we were
the only two people in the world."
735,2870932,2874390,"Prudence would stare into my eyes,
and she'd say..."
736,2874502,2876766,"- Damn.
- Damn."
737,2876971,2879064,It sort of became our song.
738,2879774,2881765,You are a very lucky man.
739,2883278,2886213,"I would like to have
a""damn"" moment like that someday."
740,2886314,2891013,"How can you be the Love Guru
if you've never been in a relationship?"
741,2891119,2893451,"Well, there is someone I like."
742,2893555,2895216,"But until I learn to love myself,"
743,2895323,2897655,"I can only go out
with three girls named Ann."
744,2897759,2899989,"- Three girls named Ann?
- Yeah."
745,2900094,2902892,"Ann Visible, Ann Flatable, and Ann Job."
746,2903998,2905329,Ann Job!
747,2907001,2909970,"Well, you know,
I deflect because of the pain."
748,2911339,2913500,"I gotta get my girl back, GP."
749,2913608,2915337,"Otherwise,
what am I gonna do with this?"
750,2916044,2918137,I have two tattoos.
751,2918246,2920111,"One tattoo is the Drama tattoo,"
752,2920214,2922182,"which signifies
the self-determinist philosophy"
753,2922283,2924342,of the Tugginmypudha Ashram.
754,2924452,2925544,And what's the other tattoo?
755,2925653,2928850,"Daffy Duck pushing a lawn mower
through my pubes."
756,2929924,2932290,"Look, he's dancing. Yeah. Right."
757,2933294,2936161,"Ball-gazer! Oh, my God! There you go!"
758,2936264,2939028,"The ball-gazing student
has become the ball-gazing master."
759,2953681,2956844,"- Saying I love you
- Saying I love you"
760,2956951,2963083,"Is not the words
I want to hear from you"
761,2963191,2968629,It's not that I want you not to say
762,2968730,2972564,But if you only knew
763,2973134,2978970,How easy it would be to
764,2979073,2983100,"- Show me how you feel
- Show me how you feel"
765,2983211,2986614,"- More than words
- More than words"
766,2986714,2992710,"- Is all you have to do to make it real
- Is all you have to do to make it real"
767,2993221,2997988,"- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Then you wouldn't have to say"
768,2998092,3001493,"- That you love me
- That you love me"
769,3001596,3008331,"- 'Cause I'd already know
- 'Cause I'd already know"
770,3015176,3018145,"- More than words
- More than words"
771,3025219,3028848,"- More than words
- More than words"
772,3032527,3034154,That was great!
773,3034262,3035923,"Thank you, Speedy. That's great."
774,3036030,3039431,Mariska Hargitay. That's great.
775,3041169,3043535,"That was lovely.
But we need to talk about Darren."
776,3043638,3047540,"- This is a disaster. He's my only...
- Jane! Do you trust me?"
777,3048543,3050170,I do trust you.
778,3051546,3052706,I'm not really sure why.
779,3052814,3056079,"It's the beard.
It makes me look like Santa."
780,3056684,3060279,"And by the way, you look breathtaking."
781,3061122,3063556,"- Thank you.
- As do I."
782,3064826,3067954,"Come.
My staff has prepared a lovely meal."
783,3070798,3072595,"- Wow.
- Right?"
784,3072700,3075669,"I am so hungry
I could eat a skunk's bottom."
785,3076571,3080769,"Which is a lot like calamari.
But that's not what we're having tonight."
786,3080875,3082843,Rajneesh will now prepare a dish
787,3082944,3085845,"made of two lychees
wrapped in a doughy pouch."
788,3085947,3090213,"- It's called Kartapal Birigalapatt.
- What's that mean?"
789,3090318,3092115,Nuts in a sling.
790,3092954,3094819,"Oh, thanks, but I'll pass."
791,3094922,3097686,"Very well, I'll have your nuts in a sling."
792,3099393,3100655,Cough.
793,3101896,3104922,"Reject this man.
Not fit for military service."
794,3105633,3108466,Would you like your nuts to be crushed?
795,3108569,3111561,Doesn't everyone? Who is this guy?
796,3120948,3122313,Geronimo!
797,3122884,3124818,That is our safe word.
798,3127355,3131621,"Now, we get the nuts nice and hot,
so they tighten up and get firm."
799,3138499,3139898,That's good.
800,3140568,3143594,"Feels good.
I mean, tastes good. I mean, what?"
801,3145807,3148002,You want curlies on your nuts?
802,3148109,3151374,"Do I look like a child?
Of course I want curlies on my nuts."
803,3151479,3153674,Don't forget your pickle.
804,3154782,3158274,"- Would you like some soup instead?
- Yes."
805,3158386,3162049,"Rajneesh, I'd like an alligator soup,
and make it snappy."
806,3163925,3168294,"Because alligators are snappy,
and at the same time, I want it prompt."
807,3170898,3174561,"Here it is. There's your soup.
Watch out! It's dangerous!"
808,3176838,3178738,You're as cute as pie.
809,3179574,3182441,"I haven't laughed like this
in such a long time."
810,3182543,3184010,Why not?
811,3184111,3187877,"It's hard to laugh
when men only see you as some curse."
812,3187982,3191008,"Jane, there is no curse."
813,3191118,3194952,"You're just afraid of intimacy,
or into-me-l-see."
814,3195056,3199152,"Remember, being vulnerable
is being woundable."
815,3199260,3201558,I say take the risk.
816,3201662,3205860,"- Well, that's easy to say and hard to do.
- Is it?"
817,3207268,3211102,"What's the downside
of throwing away your fear?"
818,3211205,3214265,The only way out is in.
819,3218079,3221446,I think I'm about to risk something.
820,3226220,3227983,"- What's wrong?
- We can't do this."
821,3228089,3229556,"What? You tell me to be vulnerable,"
822,3229657,3230715,"and then you turn around
and wound me?"
823,3230825,3233259,"- I can explain.
- Okay, go ahead."
824,3233361,3234692,I can't explain.
825,3234795,3237355,"- I should go.
- No, Jane, wait! I..."
826,3237465,3239729,Jane! Jane!
827,3241269,3245729,"Game three here in Los Angeles.
The L.A. Kings have beaten the Leafs."
828,3245840,3249970,"They are one game away
from a Stanley Cup victory."
829,3250077,3253342,"They can't be happy
in the Leafs' locker room right now."
830,3253447,3257781,"I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second.
Have they dropped the puck?"
831,3257885,3260251,Damn it! We're down three games
832,3260354,3263414,"because you decided
you couldn't win without Roanoke."
833,3263524,3266288,And you! You're just a stupid rich girl!
834,3266394,3269227,"You were born on third,
and you think you hit a triple!"
835,3269330,3270592,You don't know hockey!
836,3270698,3272563,"- Are you finished?
- No!"
837,3275202,3279070,"- Now I'm finished! And, Pitka!
- Yes?"
838,3279173,3281869,"- What's the capital of Thailand?
- Bangkok."
839,3281976,3283238,Exactly.
840,3284211,3287112,"Omar Sharif, my balls!"
841,3289784,3291843,"My balls, you prick!"
842,3295222,3297656,"- Stay down, bitch!
- Okay."
843,3299827,3301317,"Jane! Jane, wait!"
844,3301429,3305957,"He's right! I'm just a stupid rich girl
about to be a huge failure."
845,3306067,3309093,"Failure?
There's no such thing as failure."
846,3309203,3311398,Only early attempts at success.
847,3311505,3316169,"You know what? I hired you
to fix Darren Roanoke. Do your job!"
848,3320448,3322541,"Your Holiness,
I spoke with the producers at Oprah,"
849,3322650,3326211,"and if they don't see Darren and
Prudence together by the next game,"
850,3326320,3328379,your spot will go to Deepak.
851,3328489,3332084,"But Darren is not ready!
He must truly deal with his mother."
852,3332193,3336459,"- And I will not take a shortcut.
- Take a shortcut!"
853,3336564,3339692,"Do you want to be
the next Deepak Chopra or not?"
854,3355649,3358345,"Babu, you cannot take a shortcut."
855,3358452,3360886,"But I need to become
the next Deepak Chopra!"
856,3360988,3364082,"But how will you get Grande
away from Prudence?"
857,3364191,3369959,"I have one idea that just might work.
Yeah."
858,3370531,3375525,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the incredible Miss Celine Dion!"
859,3379073,3381735,Celine! It is my day of lucky!
860,3395856,3397551,What'll you have?
861,3398759,3401728,"- A martini.
- All right, then."
862,3413007,3418502,"Jacques Grande.
Is he ""Mr. Right"" or ""Mr. Right Now?"""
863,3429023,3431082,Jacques and I get along just fine.
864,3431192,3433786,"You have,
what we call in the guru business,"
865,3433894,3435589,"""love without knowledge."""
866,3435696,3439598,"But what you had with Darren
is love with knowledge."
867,3439700,3441964,A real connection.
868,3442069,3444333,Come by my ashram tomorrow at noon.
869,3444438,3447635,"I will show you a Darren
who is completely changed."
870,3447741,3449709,Do you think he's really changed?
871,3449810,3451869,"I mean, he can't even play
in front of his own mother."
872,3451979,3453640,She's like kryptonite to him.
873,3453747,3456272,Can't play in front of his mother?
874,3457318,3460776,Hey! I said stay away from the girl!
875,3460888,3464221,"Rajneesh, let's make like a baby
and head out."
876,3470231,3472699,"- So you went to see your mother?
- Yes."
877,3472800,3475360,But did you stand up to her?
878,3477304,3479169,"He doesn't have to stand up
to his mother."
879,3479273,3482470,"- Yes, he does!
- Not now, Kato."
880,3482576,3486205,"Now, aren't there a few more steps
in your Drama plan?"
881,3486313,3490807,"- Yes. Maturity and Action.
- Beat it, Rajneesh."
882,3491385,3493785,Yes. We did Maturity and Action.
883,3493888,3497619,"""M"" and ""A"" spells ""ma,"" and we went
to Buffalo and we saw his ma."
884,3497725,3499022,Right. See?
885,3499126,3502061,"You see, I left 'cause I was scared
that if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,"
886,3502163,3503357,you would leave me.
887,3503464,3506433,"But I don't care
if you win the Stanley Cup."
888,3508102,3509933,Can you forgive me?
889,3518746,3520611,Of course I can forgive you.
890,3523417,3526045,"Stick a fork in them, they're done."
891,3526153,3527780,Champers wishes!
892,3529390,3533019,"It would be great
if you could stick around for a while."
893,3535029,3536087,"You know,
just to make sure Darren's okay."
894,3536197,3537630,"Yes, of course. Yeah, business.
Yes, of course."
895,3537731,3540131,"Would His Holiness staying on
qualify as an extension?"
896,3540234,3542327,Pants! Sheket Bevakasha!
897,3542970,3546428,"Because if that were the case,
we would refuse payment."
898,3546540,3549065,"- Of course, I'll stay, Jane.
- Until we get the call from Oprah."
899,3549176,3551610,"Go to your naughty mat, Dick!"
900,3551712,3553202,Miss Bullard.
901,3555516,3557882,Mariska Hargitay.
902,3560354,3564688,"Your Holiness? Mark my words,
this shortcut will haunt you."
903,3568295,3570593,"- Congratulations.
- Well done."
904,3574835,3577030,Game four here in Los Angeles.
905,3577137,3580800,"The Kings are one win away
from a Stanley Cup victory."
906,3581642,3584975,"- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!"
907,3585079,3588014,"- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!
- Ro-an-choke! Ro-an-choke!"
908,3591752,3593947,"This is it, folks. Game four."
909,3594054,3598184,"If Roanoke doesn't pull through,
it's all over for the Leafs."
910,3601095,3602892,Roanoke with the puck.
911,3602997,3605591,"- He shoots! He scores!
- Yeah!"
912,3605699,3608964,"Wasting no time after his suspension,
he is back!"
913,3611338,3614967,"The end of game four,
and the Leafs take it two to zero."
914,3615075,3618738,"Thanks to Roanoke,
the Leafs advance to game five."
915,3619179,3620578,Go Leafs.
916,3622616,3626609,"Game five here in Los Angeles.
Can the Leafs do it again?"
917,3627288,3630416,Roanoke just playing amazing!
918,3632293,3637321,"Goal! And game five goes to the Leafs!
An incredible comeback!"
919,3637798,3641325,"Thanks to Roanoke,
the Leafs have got the Kings on the run."
920,3641435,3646168,"And look at this crowd!
They are guru crazy!"
921,3660754,3662881,Game six here in Toronto!
922,3665726,3667193,Beautiful pass!
923,3667294,3668454,Go! Go! Go!
924,3668562,3673022,"Roanoke on a breakaway!
Five-hole trap!"
925,3673133,3676432,Grande saves! Roanoke denied!
926,3677071,3680905,"- Once again, I'm Trent Lueders.
- And I'm Jay Kell."
927,3681408,3683774,Roanoke fell for the five-hole trap.
928,3683877,3687836,"For those of you who don't know
what that is, allow me to ""Kellistrate."""
929,3689750,3692810,"There are four holes.
One for each corner."
930,3693287,3696313,"The five-hole is here, between the legs."
931,3696924,3702885,"You can try to beat him here. Or here.
Or even way down here."
932,3705366,3709200,"Thanks, Jay.
Let's get back to the action."
933,3715909,3718503,Roanoke has done it! We're all tied!
934,3718612,3721547,"The Leafs have won
three straight games!"
935,3721648,3724446,Game seven will be in Toronto.
936,3724551,3726746,"- Hey!
- It's down to one game."
937,3726854,3729084,"Get me out of here, pricks!"
938,3732626,3737825,"...champion. I just got the call.
You are 100% booked on Oprah."
939,3738365,3739525,Great.
940,3740267,3742292,"I got on Oprah, right?"
941,3743036,3746494,"- I'm the next Deepak Chopra, right?
- You are."
942,3748542,3750836,He's definitely in.
943,3750944,3754345,"- Doesn't feel good, does it?
- Get off my tits!"
944,3757751,3759241,Congratulations.
945,3759353,3762720,"Darren and Prudence are back together,
we got a shot at winning the Cup,"
946,3762823,3766782,"and you got on Oprah.
I suppose all that's left is..."
947,3766894,3768327,The check.
948,3770664,3772393,Yeah. Here we go.
949,3773467,3777096,"Oh, my pretty.
Miss Bullard, it has been terrific."
950,3777204,3779798,"Now, if any of your other players
have any professional catastrophe,"
951,3779907,3784776,"personal pain, or a drug addiction,
please do not hesitate to call."
952,3784878,3787938,"Your Holiness,
the check and I will be in the car."
953,3788048,3789640,"- Cheerio.
- Bye."
954,3790350,3794252,"- I guess you got everything you wanted.
- Not everything, Jane."
955,3796190,3800490,"Well, say there was this guru, say."
956,3800594,3802994,"And this guru was, you know,
handsome, you know,"
957,3803096,3806327,"had a nice gleam in his eye,
a nice tuck in his butt, say."
958,3806433,3811166,"And say this guru,
maybe not me, maybe somebody else,"
959,3811271,3814900,had a certain vow.
960,3815709,3817540,What kind of vow?
961,3818779,3823546,"Forget about it. Just Etch A Sketch
everything I was saying."
962,3829590,3831251,Mariska Hargitay.
963,3833694,3835662,Mariska Hargitay.
964,3843670,3845763,"Well, here we go. Game seven."
965,3845873,3848671,"It all comes down to this,
ladies and gentlemen."
966,3848775,3850003,"Who do you like tonight, Jay?"
967,3851678,3852667,Jay?
968,3852779,3854906,"I like the Christmas babies, Trent!"
969,3855015,3859247,"And I like the way my skin feels
when I'm wearing my rainbow jacket!"
970,3865025,3866686,By your command.
971,3869663,3871358,"You're back on drugs, aren't you?"
972,3871465,3874491,"Yes, I am, asshole-face man!"
973,3876303,3878737,"By the power of Gahar,
I command thee to vanish!"
974,3878839,3880932,"- Let's see what's happening rinkside.
- No!"
975,3881041,3884010,"Well, here comes Lucy the elephant."
976,3884111,3886978,I cannot be killed but with fire!
977,3887080,3892211,"The Deluca Brothers Circus is
coming to town. Isn't that just adorable?"
978,3892853,3896653,"Well, whoever wins tonight
walks away Stanley Cup champions."
979,3897558,3901654,"Listen up! It's down to one game,
and we've got the momentum!"
980,3901762,3903525,"- Yeah!
- Yeah!"
981,3907935,3909493,Why you got your heads down?
982,3910571,3912436,We can beat these clowns.
983,3912539,3915770,"Besides, I still have
a few trick on my sleeve."
984,3916643,3921273,"Flight 22 to Chicago
is now boarding at Gate Five."
985,3921381,3925977,"Our plane leaves in 20 minutes.
The people at Oprah are very excited!"
986,3926086,3927178,That's great.
987,3927287,3930984,"Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing The Star-Spangled Banner,"
988,3931091,3934993,"mother of Leafs' center,
Darren Roanoke, Lillian Roanoke."
989,3935095,3937996,"That's Darren's mother!
Quaking pudding!"
990,3938332,3939856,"Hi, baby!"
991,3941635,3942602,What do I do?
992,3943804,3944828,I don't know!
993,3944938,3948066,"Oh, say, can you see"
994,3948175,3952305,By the dawn's early light
995,3952412,3955973,What so proudly we hailed
996,3957351,3958375,Hey!
997,3958485,3960350,Roanoke is freaking out...
998,3960454,3962251,"What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?"
999,3962356,3966019,"No, no! Nothing to see here.
Our plane is about to leave for Oprah,"
1000,3966126,3969618,"and we have to go realize
every dream we've ever had."
1001,3970330,3972924,"I am not going with you, Dick."
1002,3973033,3975399,"Oh, no! No!"
1003,3975502,3979700,"If you don't get on that plane,
I will take 60% of the ashram!"
1004,3980540,3983031,Fine. I don't need material things.
1005,3983944,3987903,"I was put on this earth
to spread a message of peace and love."
1006,3988015,3991416,"- Give me that ticket! Give me it!
- No! Please, no!"
1007,3995088,3998285,"You will never be
the next Deepak Chopra!"
1008,3998392,4000326,What?
1009,4008368,4009892,Box him out!
1010,4011605,4012833,"Oh, damn."
1011,4012939,4014372,"At the end of the first period,"
1012,4014474,4017238,"the Kings lead the Leafs,
one to nothing."
1013,4017344,4021610,"And the question on everyone's mind is,
where's Roanoke?"
1014,4023116,4024777,"Baby, are you all right?"
1015,4024885,4027319,"I can't play in front of you, Ma!"
1016,4027954,4032084,"It's all my fault for not putting
more pressure on you to succeed."
1017,4036563,4037552,"- Yes.
- Hello?"
1018,4037664,4039222,"Jane, I'm on my way."
1019,4039332,4041800,"- I thought you said he was cured!
- I was wrong."
1020,4042436,4044700,Tell Coach Cherkov to buy some time!
1021,4045005,4046097,Okay.
1022,4047340,4050275,"Sir, please, please make sure
it's locked, sir. Please, over there."
1023,4050377,4053505,"Thank you. Thank you, sir."
1024,4054981,4057415,"Dell Computers, this is Chip."
1025,4057984,4061476,"Rajneesh, I...
Wait a second, who is Chip?"
1026,4062155,4063144,I took another job.
1027,4063256,4065656,"Rajneesh, you have to come meet me!"
1028,4065759,4067784,I must finish my job with Darren.
1029,4067894,4069953,"- you're back, babu!
- yes!"
1030,4072499,4074467,Bodhisattva!
1031,4080006,4083464,"- Boo! You suck, Bullard!
- No, you suck!"
1032,4083577,4087741,"You can say bad things about me,
but I won't say bad things about myself!"
1033,4087848,4091909,"So, guess what?
You can all just kiss my Canadian ass!"
1034,4100427,4102054,"Cherkov, Pitka's coming. You..."
1035,4102162,4104926,Are you as turned on as I am right now?
1036,4105599,4107624,"You're a bad, bad person."
1037,4108335,4110394,I'll take that as a yes.
1038,4111004,4113268,Pitka's coming. Just stall.
1039,4115342,4117435,"Hey, ref! Time-out!"
1040,4117544,4119375,Leafs call their last time-out.
1041,4119613,4122309,"- Darren?
- Come on, baby."
1042,4122415,4125009,"- Jane!
- You lied to me!"
1043,4125118,4128349,"Yes. I only pulled away from you
because of this."
1044,4131625,4136756,"My name is the Guru Pitka,
and I wear a chastity belt."
1045,4138265,4143430,"So, you didn't reject me.
You're just devoted to a higher purpose."
1046,4143537,4144936,"Yes, Jane."
1047,4147774,4150106,"Superstar, it's me, Guru Pitka!"
1048,4150210,4152735,Good luck. He won't even let me in.
1049,4162689,4166682,"Darren, I took a shortcut with you,
and I'm sorry."
1050,4167394,4169760,"Now, what is it you can't face?"
1051,4170831,4174392,"- What did you say to me?
- What is it you can't face?"
1052,4175035,4179165,"- I can't face my ma.
- Then that's what you have to face."
1053,4179272,4181303,"- Will you help me?
- I can't."
1054,4181408,4184468,"You're on your own
when it comes to your mother."
1055,4184578,4188344,"Darren, the only way out is in."
1056,4191084,4192517,"Yes, yes, yes, it's good."
1057,4192619,4196146,"It's good, it's good,
it's good, it's good, it's good."
1058,4196256,4197723,What the hell happened to you?
1059,4197824,4202158,"Ma! I'm a grown man,
and I can take it from here."
1060,4204497,4205896,I love you.
1061,4206733,4208633,"I love you, baby boy."
1062,4213773,4217072,"Now, how long will it take you
to get dressed and get down to the ice?"
1063,4217177,4218769,"- Five minutes.
- Well, you better hurry up,"
1064,4218879,4220847,"'cause there's only six minutes
left in the game!"
1065,4220947,4224280,"Go, baby boy! Go, go, go, go, go!"
1066,4224784,4228117,I think I made a happy wee-wee. Yeah.
1067,4231024,4235620,"Come on. Let's go quickly!
Come on. Come, come. Hello?"
1068,4235795,4242462,"Action picks up here in game seven
with only 31 seconds left to go."
1069,4243103,4245901,"- Coach, I'm ready.
- Get in there!"
1070,4246940,4249272,Darren Roanoke is in the game!
1071,4257050,4260781,"Hey, Rob Blake. The first thing
they teach you about hockey"
1072,4260887,4263151,is never ever watch the puck.
1073,4278705,4281139,Roanoke's going for the Ice Slam!
1074,4282542,4283873,"- Yeah!
- Yeah!"
1075,4283977,4287674,"We're all tied up, folks,
with only eight seconds left!"
1076,4288515,4293475,"- Seven, six, five, four...
- Seven, six, five, four..."
1077,4293586,4294575,"This is it, folks."
1078,4294688,4297816,"Roanoke on the breakaway,
just him and Grande!"
1079,4300760,4304628,With one second left! It's a penalty shot.
1080,4304731,4307632,"Roanoke could win
the Stanley Cup here."
1081,4308134,4309226,Hey!
1082,4309903,4316308,"Listen, Darren, I know we are rivals,
but fate chose these sides, not us."
1083,4317243,4321304,"So, before you take this shot,
I just need to say"
1084,4324284,4325615,damn!
1085,4327988,4329546,Show it to me.
1086,4340567,4341795,Damn!
1087,4343169,4349768,"I don't know what Grande just said
to Roanoke, but he is now out to lunch."
1088,4350377,4353005,Superstar! What did he say to you?
1089,4353113,4354740,"He said, ""Damn!"""
1090,4354848,4358181,"""Damn!"" Quaking pudding.
That's not good."
1091,4358284,4360650,"- Cherkov, call a time-out.
- We're out of time-outs."
1092,4360754,4361914,Just buy us some time.
1093,4362022,4364217,"He needs a distraction. Jane, follow me!"
1094,4364324,4365951,"He's gotta take the shot, now!"
1095,4366059,4368857,I promised myself I'd never do this.
1096,4368962,4371624,"Hey, ref! I'm having a heart attack."
1097,4374067,4377059,Out of the way! Coach! Coach!
1098,4377170,4378899,Get the crash kit!
1099,4379406,4382898,"- Sir, may I borrow your elephant, Lucy?
- Sure."
1100,4383009,4387275,Bodhisattva!
1101,4390483,4393782,"Come, come! Come on, boy!
Elephant coming through!"
1102,4393887,4397084,"Come on, Bodhi!
Let's go quickly! Come on, Bodhi!"
1103,4401961,4403223,Clear!
1104,4427687,4428847,Yes!
1105,4434928,4436259,Yes!
1106,4447740,4449401,"Get busy, Bodhi."
1107,4472465,4473932,Eight seconds!
1108,4477303,4479100,What do you make of this?
1109,4479205,4483437,"I think they're doing it, Trent.
I think they're doing it hard."
1110,4484077,4486511,Let's go to the Kellistrator.
1111,4494854,4497618,The ultimate distraction!
1112,4503163,4505461,"- I love you.
- I love you."
1113,4511604,4515870,"Post-ejaculation,
the barbs at the tip of the penis retract."
1114,4515975,4519843,"Bing-bam-boom, you got
a baby pachyderm. Back to you, Trent."
1115,4525151,4528712,"Now, what happens
if you don't score this goal?"
1116,4528821,4529947,I'd still be a hero
1117,4530890,4531857,to me!
1118,4531991,4535859,"Yes! ""Gee, you are you."" TM."
1119,4538064,4539429,Go get 'em!
1120,4544704,4546934,"Come on, Roanoke! Let's go!"
1121,4556482,4557881,Five-hole!
1122,4558952,4560044,No!
1123,4562021,4563750,Five-hole trap!
1124,4571998,4576662,"The Toronto Maple Leafs
have won the Stanley Cup!"
1125,4576769,4579499,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
1126,4580006,4581405,Yeah!
1127,4583776,4588611,"- I love hockey! I love hockey!
- I love hockey, too!"
1128,4589082,4590777,They did it!
1129,4595922,4599653,"The curse is over for the Leafs,
and I need to sleep!"
1130,4605131,4607793,"We didn't waste time.
We didn't waste no time."
1131,4610003,4612904,"- Maurice?
- Deepak Chopra!"
1132,4613506,4616202,"Oprah called me,
and she said you canceled."
1133,4616309,4618470,"I told her
she should give you another chance."
1134,4618578,4623845,"As great as you are, I don't need
to become the next Deepak Chopra."
1135,4623950,4626180,I am the first Guru Pitka!
1136,4626953,4628420,You are free.
1137,4628521,4630921,"You're a good man, Deepak Chopra."
1138,4632125,4635686,"Hey, Pitka?
Sorry I punched you in the nuts."
1139,4636663,4638961,That's okay. Give me a hug.
1140,4643436,4646132,"If you ever sucker punch me again,"
1141,4646239,4650073,"I'll kick your ass all the way back
to the Keebler factory."
1142,4651744,4654838,Give me a pound. Lock it down.
1143,4654947,4657780,"Break the pickle. Tickle, tickle."
1144,4658718,4659878,"- You.
- No, you."
1145,4659986,4662079,"- Come on now, you.
- No, you."
1146,4662188,4663746,"Well, no, you."
1147,4674334,4678065,"And so our story ends
where it all began,"
1148,4678871,4682932,"here in the tiny Indian village
of Harenmahkeester,"
1149,4683042,4685408,in the valley of Lintinmybelli.
1150,4685511,4687103,"Oh, hi."
1151,4687213,4691115,"- Maurice.
- Oh, my God. You look so beautiful."
1152,4691984,4693474,Thank you.
1153,4694454,4698652,"Maurice.
You have finally learned to love yourself."
1154,4698758,4701750,"You may now renounce
your vow of chastity."
1155,4701861,4703726,May I have the key?
1156,4708101,4711593,There is no key. There never was.
1157,4711704,4713797,There's a snap in the back.
1158,4719612,4724015,"Thank you, Guru Tugginmypudha. Yeah."
1159,4724550,4725744,Are you leaving?
1160,4725852,4731313,"The last rule of guru
is to rid student of the need of guru."
1161,4731958,4733516,"Yes, of course."
1162,4738731,4740699,"Okay, see you."
1163,4742969,4744960,Doesn't work sometimes.
1164,4746572,4748733,"So, what do you want to do now?"
1165,4748841,4751173,"Well, I've been wearing this belt
since I was 12 years old."
1166,4751277,4753871,What do you think I want to do now?
1167,4754380,4755574,I want to sing!
