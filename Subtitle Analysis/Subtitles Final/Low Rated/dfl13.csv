2,50828,52761,Let me tell you somethin'.
3,52763,55332,"New York is the greatest fuckin'
city in the world."
4,55399,56798,My city.
5,56800,58433,"I was a kid in these streets,"
6,58435,62037,"I started in the fuckin' gutter,
and I made it to the top."
7,62039,66375,"This life ends one of two ways,
dead or in jail."
8,66377,67912,I did both.
9,143488,146556,"I made my bones doin' a piece
of work for Don Carlo Gambino."
10,146558,149694,"I don't need to tell you
what happened. You know."
11,150395,153062,But the commission is moving.
12,153064,156367,"The families will not allow this
type of crime to go unchecked."
13,157402,159402,"I mean, Carlo, he paid
the kidnappers."
14,159404,161271,"He complied
with their every demand."
15,161273,163172,And how did they respond?
16,163174,165543,"By leaving the kid
in a fuckin' Dumpster."
17,166411,170146,"Now, each of the families
is organizing a team"
18,170148,172882,"to head the hunt
for the kidnappers."
19,172884,175852,"But as far as I'm concerned,
this is a Gambino matter."
20,175854,177487,"And we will not
fuckin' stand down."
21,177489,179523,This is our responsibility.
22,179525,183928,"So John, I want you
to head the Gambino team."
23,184195,185462,"We're not only
doing this for Carlo,"
24,185464,187632,"we're doing this
for the whole family."
25,188099,189932,I understand.
26,189934,191937,"I want you to take care
of this for me."
27,194440,196607,It would be an honor.
28,197309,198810,Consider it done.
29,210623,213826,"Ah, Jesus Christ,
you look at these fuckin' bums?"
30,215661,217461,"Missy, hit me again, will ya?"
31,217463,218897,"Whisky neat, coming right up."
32,241687,245657,"James McBratney?
You're under arrest."
33,250696,253263,"I guess somebody better
call the cops then, huh?"
34,264176,265844,Let's go.
35,268647,270314,Motherfucker!
36,270316,272149,Hey! Down.
37,273452,275419,Not a word.
38,275421,277654,"After I had a
successful hit under my belt,"
39,277656,281058,"Carlo Gambino opened up the books
for the first time since 1957."
40,281060,284630,"And like that,
I became a made man."
41,312091,314024,"Can you believe the way
they bring me in here?"
42,314026,317030,"Like I'm Hannibal the fucking
Cannibal or something."
43,317263,319329,I got the trifecta.
44,319331,322132,"I got jaw, neck and throat."
45,322134,324536,"They took my tit
and they put it on my face."
46,324538,328172,"I only do one-armed pushups 'cause
they took the whole chest muscle out."
47,328174,331241,"- Those fucking butchers.
- Yeah."
48,331243,335012,"My body betrayed me, John, but
not my mind, and not my heart."
49,335014,336748,That'll never happen.
50,337417,339149,"I'm still here, John."
51,339151,342155,"I'm still motherfuckin'
these guys at every turn."
52,345024,349095,So... what's up?
53,350129,351629,They ordered me a visit.
54,351631,353431,"I thought at least
I'd maybe get a phone call,"
55,353433,355935,"but the judge insisted
I get the visit."
56,357069,360371,"John, they didn't do this out of
the kindness of their hearts."
57,360373,362241,So I'm gonna ask you again.
58,362809,364210,What's up?
59,369583,371684,"I'm thinking
about taking a plea."
60,376389,377924,A plea?
61,381394,384998,"And what are their expectations
of you in this plea?"
62,386466,388634,"Five and a half
to seven years."
63,388768,391070,"Five and a half or seven?
Which is it?"
64,392639,396474,"Look, I don't want you should stay in
prison one motherfucking more day."
65,396476,399846,"I would rather have this
cancer than you have a cold."
66,400180,402247,"But, I'm tellin' you,
if I robbed a church"
67,402249,404382,"and I had the steeple
sticking out of my ass,"
68,404384,406518,"- I would deny it.
- I know, Dad. I know..."
69,406520,409187,"Okay, so I'm telling you,
as a father..."
70,409189,411991,"not as a boss,
but as a father..."
71,412793,415794,"if you say that you're innocent,
I believe you."
72,415796,420431,"So why would you stand up in front of these
motherfuckers and say that you're guilty?"
73,420433,423167,"- Why would you do that?
- Because if I take this plea, it's over."
74,423169,426471,"They're not gonna keep coming
after me with more charges."
75,426473,427907,I get closure.
76,428776,430676,Closure.
77,430811,433244,"Let me make sure I
heard that straight."
78,433246,434847,"""Closure."""
79,434849,437716,"What kind of a mealy-mouth
word is that?"
80,437718,441820,"This is a... this is a word
for over-educated,"
81,441822,444224,"under-intelligent
motherfuckers."
82,445191,447325,"This is not a word that's
in my vocabulary."
83,447327,449260,"My boys are still
young kids, Dad."
84,449262,453332,"If I take this plea, I'm back with
them before they're teenagers."
85,453334,455901,"If I lose at trial,
I'm doing 20 years."
86,455903,457736,Like they never had a father.
87,457738,459638,She's a nice woman.
88,459640,462341,"She's a nice woman now
'cause she's dying of cancer."
89,462343,464175,"Two weeks ago
everybody hated her."
90,464177,465578,Now she's Miss Popularity.
91,465580,467081,"I'm just...
I'm just sayin'."
92,468316,470416,"- When's Halloween?
- Next week."
93,470418,472685,"Next week, this week,
what do I know?"
94,472687,474887,"Every day is Halloween
in this place."
95,474889,477156,What are you gonna be?
96,477158,478891,"Officer Mike down the block's gonna
let me use his policeman's hat."
97,478893,480693,I'm going as a cop.
98,480695,482528,"- What's the matter with you?
- With me?"
99,482530,483729,"What are you doing
to my son?"
100,483731,485531,"Oh, so now
he's your son alone?"
101,485533,486899,"'Cause of you,
I'm alone with them."
102,486901,488867,"Let me tell you somethin'.
No kid of mine"
103,488869,491403,"is gonna be a cop for Halloween,
and that's it."
104,491405,493472,"- It's not gonna happen.
- Johnny, he's just a kid."
105,493474,495841,"Today he wants to be a cop,
tomorrow an astronaut."
106,495843,499445,"If I ever hear that you let my son or any
of my kids... or you for that matter..."
107,499447,501847,"talk to that cop or any cop,
I'll kill you."
108,501849,504750,"Relax, he's just being
nice to your son."
109,504752,506418,"Don't make me
repeat myself, Victoria."
110,506420,508854,"And you...
you don't dress like a cop,"
111,508856,511323,"you don't act like a cop,
and you don't talk like a cop."
112,511325,512292,You understand me?
113,515730,517897,"- What the matter with you?
- Me? What's the matter with you?"
114,517899,520699,"Don't start, Victoria, okay?
I'm not in the mood."
115,520701,521901,Don't talk to me like that.
116,521903,523335,"You think you're such
a tough guy."
117,523337,524670,"Do you know what
you're doing to this family?"
118,524672,526472,And you're gonna kill me?
119,526474,528440,"- I'd like to see you try.
- Don't get smart with me."
120,528442,529943,"Now, look, what do you wanna...
What do you want to be?"
121,529945,532444,"Why don't you ask him
what he wants to be instead?"
122,532446,534546,"- What do you wanna be?
- Um, a baseball player?"
123,534548,536248,"No, no. You don't wanna
be a baseball player."
124,536250,538550,"Why don't you be
Casper the Ghost? You put a..."
125,538552,540654,"You put a sheet over
and make the holes..."
126,540656,542354,"- Casper's for five-year-olds.
- What was you? What was you last year?"
127,542356,544390,"You were a princess
last year, right?"
128,544392,547060,"- And what was you? You was a...
- Time's up, Gotti."
129,547729,549261,Ah! Gotta go.
130,549263,550931,"- I love youse.
- I love you, too."
131,552567,555001,"After being ID'd
by the barmaid,"
132,555003,556903,"- they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary...
- Give me a kiss."
133,556905,560074,"...where I served two years
out of a four-year sentence."
134,582964,584631,"With the guards
in my back pocket,"
135,584633,589103,"I was able to get medical furloughs
to see the family dentist."
136,599781,601815,"Not a cavity in sight,
Mr. Gotti."
137,601817,605019,"- We'll see you next time.
- Thanks."
138,616498,618431,"And while I was at it,"
139,618433,621202,"I was able to clean up some
unfinished McBratney business."
140,689705,692139,"Remember what I
used to tell youse guys?"
141,692141,695375,"It was me, Angelo and Frankie,
we'd say we was goin' out of town"
142,695377,697077,"and that we were
at a construction job."
143,697079,700147,"We was gonna build this big wall,
and it was gonna take three years."
144,700149,702384,Remember? Yeah.
145,704720,708055,"John, I want what's best
for you and your family."
146,708057,709857,"I know that, Dad,
I know."
147,709859,713761,"And the idea of just one day you
being in prison makes me sick."
148,713763,716397,"But I don't know what makes
me sicker, you being in prison,"
149,716399,718432,"or you bowing to these
pieces of shit."
150,718434,721101,"What bowing? There's no
bowing, it's a compromise."
151,721103,723838,"They get their pound of flesh,
I get my peace of mind."
152,723840,727142,"The peace of mind that one day I'll be
there for my family when I am needed."
153,727144,728843,"- Oh, John. John!
- That's what this is."
154,728845,731078,How could you be so naive?
155,731080,734115,"Once they get you in, you will never
be free again. Do you understand that?"
156,734117,737152,"They say you win this time, but next
time, they'll make sure that you don't."
157,737154,738719,"There won't be
a next time."
158,738721,740988,"I've always felt in my heart
that the day would come"
159,740990,743524,"when my family and I'd
get separated by prison."
160,743526,745860,"I'm just thankful
it isn't for life."
161,745862,748063,"And this plea
will ensure that."
162,748065,749965,"I had high hopes
for Johnny Boy."
163,749967,752867,"Me? I was born with four
fuckin' cents to my name."
164,752869,755870,"And now I got a kid going
to the New York Military Academy."
165,755872,757838,"Johnny Boy, come on!"
166,757840,759975,Let's go! We ain't got all day.
167,761611,763111,"What's the matter?
You guys look like"
168,763113,765847,"your brother's going
to the electric chair. Cheer up."
169,765849,768515,"Why don't you go, uh,
go get some ice cream."
170,768517,770051,"- Pizza or something.
- I don't like ice cream."
171,770053,772153,"Get Fudge Sticks.
You love Fudge Sticks, get them."
172,772155,773922,"- I don't like pizza, either.
- How 'bout the movies?"
173,773924,775757,"You like... What's that movie
you like so much?"
174,775759,777893,"About spaghetti.
Meatballs or something."
175,777895,779160,Go see that.
176,779162,781398,Come on. We ain't got all day!
177,782032,783500,"All right, guys."
178,784667,786269,Come here.
179,787204,789804,"All right, you guys better not get
into any trouble while I'm gone."
180,789806,791706,"Look out for your brother,
all right?"
181,791708,793574,"- Give me a hug.
- All right, enough, enough."
182,793576,795777,"- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- I'll see ya."
183,795779,797145,"- Wait, wait. Hey, hey.
- Ma! Ma, I gotta go."
184,797147,800015,"- Butch, please!
- Ma, I gotta go."
185,800017,802117,"I made youse a tuna sandwich
for the road."
186,802119,805221,"Okay, you know what? You're
gonna see him this weekend."
187,813931,815563,"At my house,
more often than not,"
188,815565,817300,"- was Angelo Ruggiero.
- Hey, Pete."
189,817701,819100,"My best friend
since we was kids."
190,819102,820835,"- Hey, Ange.
- Hey, Vic."
191,820837,823004,"- He up yet?
- You talk to him. I've tried."
192,823006,824839,"Hey, Uncle Ange."
193,824841,827108,Hey. Whoa.
194,827110,830213,"You know what's good for you, don't
let your dad see that cop car."
195,831548,833515,"Come on, you fucking prick.
Come on, co..."
196,833517,836084,"Look at this. Come on. Ah, co..."
197,836086,837953,"Oh, motherfucker!"
198,837955,839087,"You know what
fuckin' time it is?"
199,839089,840922,"Did you see that?
Did you see that?"
200,840924,842123,I got six dimes on Buffalo.
201,842125,843692,"They're killin' us,
ten to nothin'."
202,843694,845994,"I put six dimes on New England,
they're killin' us."
203,845996,848163,"I put six dimes on Chicago,
they're losin'."
204,848165,850565,"And now I put three dimes
on Kansas City."
205,850567,852268,"They're winning,
but they'll fucking blow it."
206,852270,854203,"- Motherfuckers!
- Maybe you should hang yourself."
207,854205,855371,"- Leave your troubles behind.
- Smart ass."
208,855373,857973,"Listen, you wouldn't believe
how much I lost last week."
209,857975,859574,"Don't wanna believe.
Don't wanna know."
210,859576,861243,"Just once, you know, I'd give
my fuckin' life,"
211,861245,863578,"just that to have
the Redskins win once."
212,863580,865482,"I got a Redskin named
Willie Boy in the car."
213,865816,867049,I gotta clean up.
214,867051,869986,Motherfuckers!
215,870654,873223,"- Uncle Ange, look.
- Whatcha got there, Frankie?"
216,873757,877126,"Oh! No, you didn't.
Straight A's?"
217,877128,878860,"I've never seen
anything like this."
218,878862,881263,"Hey, Frankie Boy, you show
Uncle Ange your report card?"
219,881265,883265,"Can you believe it?
My son's a goddamn genius."
220,883267,885600,"My Frankie's gonna be
a rocket scientist."
221,885602,887136,"- What do you think about that, Ange?
- Let's go."
222,887138,888603,We won't be home for dinner.
223,888605,890006,"What are you talking about?
It's Sunday night."
224,890008,891639,"I gotta repeat myself?
I'm not comin' home for dinner!"
225,891641,894712,"- Johnny, it's family night!
- I'll make it up to youse."

District has long been central"
227,897882,900783,"to the Mafia's portfolio
of lucrative rackets,"

to the Mob's historic"
229,904022,906621,"stranglehold on trucking
and labor unions."
230,906623,909624,"Authorities believe
that this man, John Gotti,"
231,909626,911827,"a feared captain
in the Gambino family,"
232,911829,914063,"is the mobster

233,914065,916899,"of extortion, corruption,
and robbery"

235,920872,925409,"Gotti is perceived as an up and comer
in the Mafia organized crime family..."
236,925710,928646,"Johnny Boy was tough.
He knew how to handle himself."
237,928880,932348,"I told him tell anybody who had the balls
to ask what his father did for a living"
238,932350,935651,"that I was a 24-hour,
seven-days-a-week street guy."
239,935653,937787,"Who's this fucking
guy think he is, huh?"
240,937789,940256,"He's Greek. He doesn't have his
head screwed up straight."
241,940258,942058,"What, he just got
off the boat yesterday?"
242,942060,944860,"Who gave him permission
to run book in Howard Beach?"
243,944862,946128,"- Who?
- I... I told him."
244,946130,947863,"- I read him the riot act.
- Why did you tell him?"
245,947865,951569,"This motherfucker's on the
phone talking about me! My name!"
246,951936,953403,"He says he's
with the Greek mafia."
247,953405,955806,"This mook is so
full of shit it ain't funny."
248,956174,957873,"Ms. Luzio, hold up, hold up."
249,957875,960678,"Lou. Louie, go help her."
250,960878,962379,"I'll take care of it,
Mr. Gotti."
251,962381,964880,"Get that shit off your face.
He looks like a beatnik."
252,964882,967250,"Why don't you grab 50 percent
of this asshole's business?"
253,967252,969051,I want this shut down yesterday.
254,969053,970753,"You understand?
This guy's a nobody,"
255,970755,972988,"and even if he was a somebody,
I don't give a fuck."
256,972990,975359,"- You understand me?
- Yeah."
257,976261,979028,"- Hey, hey, hey!
- Mr. Gotti, how are you?"
258,979030,981198,"You're still in the fight?
Yeah, you still working out?"
259,981200,983032,Not that much anymore.
260,983034,985168,"No? What's the matter?
You was the great white hope."
261,985170,987572,"Well, they just fucking
closed down Tully's."
262,987805,989872,"Tully's an institution.
How long's Tully been around?"
263,989874,992242,"I've been walking
by Tully's for 40 years."
264,992710,993976,"What happened?
What the fuck happened?"
265,993978,995911,"I don't know.
Rent's goin' up."
266,995913,998448,"They got cited for some code
violation or something."
267,998450,1000850,"Yeah. Well, don't you worry.
They're back in business."
268,1000852,1003453,"All right. How's your father?
How's his liver?"
269,1003455,1006456,"He's... He's still here.
He's still here."
270,1006458,1009758,"All right, man. Well, you tell
him hello from me, all right?"
271,1009760,1012229,"- Gotti, thank you. Thank you.
- All right."
272,1012231,1014231,"All right.
Come back to the center."
273,1014233,1016199,"I don't give a fuck
who this guy is."
274,1016201,1018101,"He's using my name
on the phone."
275,1018103,1020070,So you tell this cocksucker
276,1020072,1022472,"that if he ever deals
another card in Queens,"
277,1022474,1024908,"or ever even whispers
my name again,"
278,1024910,1029381,"I, me, John Gotti, will sever
his motherfucking head off!"
279,1032384,1034786,"- Put a little ice on it.
- Ma, I'm... Ma!"
280,1035187,1037756,"Okay. I'll fix you
something to eat."
281,1040492,1042661,Get your feet off the couch.
282,1042828,1043828,Get up.
283,1049468,1053303,"You got suspended, huh?
What do you think you're doing?"
284,1053305,1056106,"These local kids jumped
a couple of our guys."
285,1056108,1057040,"We're just handling
our business."
286,1057042,1058643,You're handling your business?
287,1059878,1061780,"- Yeah. I guess.
- You guess."
288,1063315,1064448,You show up?
289,1064450,1066484,Yeah. I'd say so.
290,1068987,1071054,Attaboy.
291,1071056,1073725,"You stood your ground.
You didn't back off."
292,1074092,1076460,"Never back off.
You always stand up."
293,1076462,1078529,"You fight till you
can't fight no more."
294,1078531,1081264,"Never take a backwards
step, ever."
295,1081266,1084536,"Dad, I'm thinking maybe I don't
wanna try for West Point anymore."
296,1085204,1087037,Maybe take a year off.
297,1087039,1090106,"Take a year off? Drop out of school?
Not go to college?"
298,1090108,1092745,"Become a bum on the street?
Is that what you want?"
299,1095548,1098650,Huh? What are you thinking?
300,1102120,1104155,"You wanna
hang out with me?"
301,1104157,1105556,Is that what you're thinking?
302,1105558,1107392,Jesus Christ.
303,1108794,1110295,Ah!
304,1111029,1112998,Butch! I'm hungry!
305,1120839,1123007,"If they get it,
they're good."
306,1123009,1126577,"It's just like if they're good,
they get what they get paid."
307,1126579,1128914,"- A lot of 'em are bums.
- That's for sure."
308,1132318,1134787,"- Ah.
- The Luccheses are here."
309,1138124,1140793,"- I don't like that guy.
- Which one?"
310,1141394,1143529,His name is Gaspipe.
311,1143563,1145396,"Oh, yeah.
I heard of him."
312,1145398,1147131,He's trouble.
313,1147133,1150334,"He's up in Angelo's face about
them apartments on 59th Street."
314,1150336,1152503,I hear he's a real sicko.
315,1152505,1154138,Look at him. Look at him.
316,1154140,1157576,"He's making sure all
the families know his name."
317,1157977,1159543,The prick.
318,1159545,1162179,Relax. He's not our business.
319,1162181,1165316,"- Sweetheart? Can we get another round here, please?
- You got it."
320,1165318,1167551,"- Let me ask you something.
- Hm."
321,1167553,1171155,"What do you think the Genovese
capos think of the boss?"
322,1171157,1173190,What are you talking about?
323,1173192,1175226,"I mean, I understand
the whole insanity plea,"
324,1175228,1178929,"but come on, running around town
in the fucking pajamas,"
325,1178931,1181132,give me a fucking break.
326,1181134,1183100,"Vincent ""The Chin"" Gigante.
According to the government,"
327,1183102,1186137,"the powerful boss
of the Genovese crime family."
328,1186139,1187938,"To me, he was a rival."
329,1187940,1190174,Chin is a very smart guy.
330,1190176,1192644,"He runs his family
as he sees fit."
331,1192646,1195179,I can tell you this:
332,1195181,1197649,"You would never see Chin and his crew in a
place like this, that's for fucking sure."
333,1197651,1200985,"Well, talking
about bosses who hide..."
334,1200987,1202621,Don't start.
335,1202623,1204489,"I'm just telling you, he's not here.
He's never here."
336,1204491,1207892,"How can you run a family if you're
not on the ground with them?"
337,1207894,1210027,"Johnny, you have got
to shut the fuck up."
338,1210029,1213666,"Paul is your boss.
End of fuckin' story."
339,1216403,1218169,"Who's this?
Who is that guy with Frankie?"
340,1218171,1220639,What's his name again?
341,1220641,1222507,"- That's Sammy Bull.
- That's Sammy."
342,1222509,1223575,Why Bull?
343,1223577,1225277,"Bulls Head,
Staten Island."
344,1225279,1226847,I know about him.
345,1227481,1229581,"You don't like
anybody here tonight."
346,1229583,1232351,"I just don't like what I hear about
him, okay? That's all I'm saying."
347,1232353,1234386,"He's a good earner
and he's Frankie's guy."
348,1234388,1235687,He ain't never done time.
349,1235689,1238657,"And I don't trust anybody
who's never done time."
350,1238659,1240925,"Well, he's our friend now."
351,1240927,1243028,"And listen, you trust Frankie,
don't you?"
352,1243030,1245263,"Frankie would vouch to the
fucking moon for this kid."
353,1245265,1246665,"- We gotta give him a chance.
- Here they come."
354,1246667,1250602,"Hi boys. How you doing tonight?
Hey, Johnnie."
355,1250604,1253004,"- How you doing, Neil?
- How are you, Sammy?"
356,1253006,1255942,"- Frank.
- Frankie."
357,1256076,1257676,"Sammy, I'd like you to meet
a good friend of ours"
358,1257678,1260614,"and a dear friend
of mine, John Gotti."
359,1262316,1264683,"How you doing, John? Heard a
lot about you from Frankie."
360,1264685,1267085,"- Glad to finally meet.
- All good, I hope."
361,1267087,1269054,"Of course it's good. How am I
gonna talk about my brother?"
362,1269056,1271089,Let me tell you somethin'.
363,1271091,1274025,"Time in Lewisburg will make a man
out of you. Am I right, Frankie?"
364,1274027,1276429,"You come out of there
thicker than thieves."
365,1276964,1278698,"- Right?
- My fuckin' brother, Johnny."
366,1279266,1281534,"Let's raise a glass
to our new friend."
367,1281702,1283603,"- Salute, guys.
- Salute."
368,1284004,1286606,"- Neil.
- Frankie."
369,1292045,1293780,You trust this kid?
370,1298653,1300154,Thank you.
371,1302089,1306458,"John... we walk together
and we fall together."
372,1306460,1309027,This is the life.
373,1309029,1311096,"I chose my side
over 40 years ago."
374,1311098,1313165,"The hardest thing
in this world for me to do"
375,1313167,1315267,"would be to have to
say goodbye to my kids."
376,1315269,1316769,"- I can't do it.
- I don't want you to."
377,1316771,1318638,"I don't want you have to lie
to your kids and you telling 'em"
378,1318640,1320473,"you are on some
construction job."
379,1320475,1323074,"You and me, John, we never
had to lie to each other."
380,1323076,1325445,"But it's the lies
you tell yourself,"
381,1325447,1327614,"these are the lies
you gotta live with."
382,1329617,1332519,"And missing your kids?
You think that's bad?"
383,1333287,1335022,Do I really have to say it?
384,1335457,1336824,Do I?
385,1342196,1343931,Frankie.
386,1345400,1346699,"No, leave the light on."
387,1346701,1348601,"Frankie,
we're just down the hall."
388,1348603,1351036,"Let him leave the light on.
Kids are scared of the dark."
389,1351038,1352605,Just till John gets back?
390,1352607,1354775,"- Till John gets back.
- Okay."
391,1356411,1358811,"G'night, Frankie.
Love you. See you tomorrow."
392,1358813,1360214,Love you.

419,1643901,1645834,"Come on, I'm late. What the
hell are you waiting for?"
420,1654879,1656945,"- What are you doing?
- He's cold."
421,1656947,1659748,"- Vicky, come here. Come here.
- I have to bring him a blanket!"
422,1659750,1662151,"- No! No!
- Come here."
423,1663353,1665419,"Johnny, no!"
424,1665421,1668057,"Come here.
It's gonna be fine."
425,1668424,1670025,No!
426,1670027,1671660,"Calm down. Calm down.
Vicky."
427,1671662,1674431,"- Johnny, Johnny, I need to go to...
- Calm down."
428,1674799,1676966,"Come here, baby."
429,1677433,1680602,"Listen to me.
Listen to me. I need to go."
430,1680604,1684640,"Okay. I need to bring my
little Frankie a blanket!"
431,1702059,1704993,"What happened?
Is Vicky okay?"
432,1704995,1708564,"This piece of shit Favara. She smacked
him around with a baseball bat."
433,1708566,1709798,She's gonna be all right.
434,1709800,1712000,"He's a stupid
fucking asshole, John."
435,1712002,1713902,"He never fixed
the dent in their car."
436,1713904,1717974,"He leaves it there in the driveway,
day after day, for Vicky to see."
437,1718108,1722411,"John. We can't know why
God lets these things happen,"
438,1722413,1724481,but there has to be a reason.
439,1724782,1726183,A reason?
440,1726550,1728118,For these things?
441,1728552,1729785,He was 12 years old.
442,1729787,1731355,"He didn't have a hair
on his prick."
443,1732089,1734458,"There ain't no fuckin' reason.
There ain't no fuckin' God."
444,1734491,1736426,Don't say another word.
445,1741866,1745402,"I'm gonna take Vicky down
to Florida, see her family."
446,1745703,1749139,"I think it'd be good for us.
Clear her head."
447,1763154,1765821,"On March 12, 1980,
12-year-old Frank Gotti"
448,1765823,1769491,"was riding his mini-bike
on this street, 157th Avenue,"
449,1769493,1771493,"just three blocks
from his home."
450,1771495,1775464,"John Favara's car hit 12-year-old
Frank Gotti and killed him."
451,1775466,1779470,"People who know the Gottis say they never
came to terms with young Frank's death."
452,1779603,1783006,"Police, however, believe someone did
come to terms with John Favara."
453,1783008,1786776,"On July 28th, Favara left his
job and walked to his car,"
454,1786778,1788978,"which was parked next door
at the Capitol Diner."
455,1788980,1791613,"The diner's owner told police
he saw three men"
456,1791615,1794050,"club Favara and shove him
into a van."
457,1794052,1798520,"The best witness police had in the
abduction of John Favara was Leon Papon,"
458,1798522,1800623,"the man who owned the diner.
He had seen the whole thing."
459,1800625,1803026,"He told that
to Nassau County Police."
460,1803028,1806229,"But then the assailants returned
to the diner several days later."
461,1806231,1808564,They reportedly ordered coffee.
462,1808566,1811034,"And as they sipped it,
they stared at Papon."
463,1811036,1815571,"Right after that, Papon stopped cooperating
with Nassau County detectives."
464,1815573,1817507,"His memory
of the incident faded."
465,1817509,1820445,"He sold the diner
and moved away."
466,1827052,1829987,"Okay, that's it. That's it."
467,1830021,1833424,That's it. That's it. That's it.
468,1833858,1835226,Vicky.
469,1835694,1837228,Enough.
470,1837662,1839263,"I love you,
but we got four other kids."
471,1839265,1841965,"We will never let go of Frankie,
you understand me?"
472,1841967,1844335,"Never. He's in
our hearts forever."
473,1845003,1847538,Forever. Till the day we die.
474,1847639,1850074,"We're gonna always
live like we're seven."
475,1852244,1854145,I'm gonna make you some coffee.
476,1869028,1870562,"No problem.
Merry Christmas."
477,1874200,1875332,Look at him.
478,1875334,1878168,"That lousy bastard,
my father."
479,1878170,1880670,"Turns out to be a good grandpa.
Who knew?"
480,1880672,1882572,You never know.
481,1882574,1885142,"I'll tell you something. Maybe if
we didn't have such crappy parents,"
482,1885144,1886676,"we wouldn't have
so much in common."
483,1886678,1888078,You know what I'm sayin'?
484,1888080,1891315,"Yeah, I'd be living in Flatbush,
married to a dentist."
485,1891317,1893283,"What are you talking about?
You get..."
486,1893285,1896253,"You get a bad tooth, I'll be happy
to knock it right out of your mouth."
487,1898224,1901293,"There's my smile.
There's my girl."
488,1901994,1904995,"Bet you didn't think you'd be
serving 100 people in this house."
489,1904997,1907566,"Yeah, one night
a year I can handle."
490,1908034,1909967,"- Yeah?
- Can you believe it?"
491,1909969,1912602,"We used to barely have
enough for the two of us."
492,1912604,1915072,"But we had each other,
that's all that matters."
493,1915607,1917207,That's all that matters.
494,1917209,1919511,"You and me, we'll get
through this together."
495,1920079,1921513,We'll get through anything.
496,1923049,1926250,"- Ho!
- Hey, Merry Christmas."
497,1926252,1927284,Merry Christmas.
498,1927286,1929221,"Hey, Neil."
499,1930056,1932224,"I've been meaning to ask you. Who
is that guy sitting in my chair?"
500,1932391,1934725,You've been meaning to ask?
501,1934727,1938062,"That guy's been in your chair every
Christmas for the last 15 years."
502,1938064,1940432,Hey!
503,1942001,1943700,What can I get you to drink?
504,1943702,1945069,How about a cigar?
505,1945071,1946370,"- Let's do it.
- Yeah. Let's do it."
506,1946372,1949039,"Sammy Gravano
told me something."
507,1949041,1950340,What did Sammy Gravano say?
508,1950342,1952943,"That you was over at Paul's
house just now."
509,1952945,1954978,"Yeah, I was at Paul's
house just now."
510,1954980,1956180,Did you see Sammy there?
511,1956182,1958784,"I just stopped by
for two minutes."
512,1959285,1962754,"Well, he tells Paul, he says, ""I wanna go
see Neil to wish him a Merry Christmas."""
513,1963856,1965856,"Why do I give a shit
about all this?"
514,1965858,1968192,"'Cause Paul said ""What the hell you
wanna do that for? You're on our side."""
515,1968194,1969860,"And what did Sammy
say to that?"
516,1969862,1971731,"He said ""We're all
a family, ain't we?"
517,1972064,1974199,"And Neil's the underboss."""
518,1975734,1976733,Sammy told you that?
519,1976735,1978437,Sammy told me.
520,1992185,1993917,Hey! What's happening?
521,2016877,2020845,"♪ I've got it good
That's what they say ♪"
522,2020847,2022448,Paul!
523,2023183,2025083,"Paul Castellano was
a fucking fish in the desert."
524,2025085,2026885,A fish out of water.
525,2026887,2028987,I never respected Paul.
526,2028989,2032323,"As an underboss, Neil was more
of a boss than Paul ever was."
527,2032325,2035261,"- Give my regards to Victoria.
- I will, thanks."
528,2035729,2037764,She'll be glad to hear it.
529,2038331,2041234,♪ But I'd rather be lucky ♪
530,2041902,2044604,♪ Be lucky with you ♪
531,2047374,2049507,"♪ Cards, craps, or slots ♪"
532,2049509,2052879,♪ That's not my way ♪
533,2053880,2055980,"♪ Still, I'd rather be lucky ♪"
534,2055982,2058483,"I'm just saying, if Paul goes
to prison for them indictments,"
535,2058485,2060818,"they're gonna make
Tommy Bilotti street boss."
536,2060820,2063388,"Happy days. We can all go
into the wig business."
537,2063390,2066191,"Come on, Neil,
what's going on here?"
538,2066193,2068760,"Keepin' Paul
in silk pajamas."
539,2068762,2070261,"He's more concerned making deals with
other families than his own borgata."
540,2070263,2072030,"He's the boss!
End of fuckin' story."
541,2072032,2075133,"Time magazine says
you're the boss."
542,2075135,2077804,"Shows you what a disreputable
fucking profession that is."
543,2077971,2079371,"You know why?
Let me tell you why."
544,2079373,2081206,"I'll tell you why.
Because we've never been"
545,2081208,2083141,"under this kind
of scrutiny before."
546,2083143,2085043,"No. They can see you, Neil."
547,2085045,2087045,"Yeah, too fuckin' much,
evidently."
548,2087047,2089247,"No, no, no, no. You can sit, you
can talk man-to-man with you."
549,2089249,2091216,You know what I'm saying?
550,2091218,2095053,"I mean what's Paul's contribution to
society, fuckin' his Portuguese maid?"
551,2095055,2097289,"As long as it keeps him
off of my back."
552,2097291,2100825,"But, 35 years in the same house as
his wife, I mean, that ain't right."
553,2100827,2102561,That ain't right.
554,2104030,2106232,"Course, you gotta
give him credit."
555,2106334,2108500,"Credit for what,
his penile implant?"
556,2108502,2110469,"You got his house bugged, do you?"
557,2110471,2114073,"Yeah, I defeated that $50,000
security system with my good looks."
558,2114075,2115873,"That Portuguese maid
was crazy about me."
559,2115875,2119044,"She's Guatemalan,
you know so fucking much."
560,2119046,2122181,"Did you ever see her? Whatever country
she's from, they probably made her leave."
561,2122183,2123848,"I wouldn't fuck her
with your dick."
562,2126387,2130489,"Listen, Paul's got diabetes.
What're you gonna do? Huh?"
563,2130491,2132857,"It's not a subject I feel
comfortable discuss..."
564,2132859,2135194,"- What the fuck is so fucking funny?
- I'm sorry."
565,2135196,2137196,"He's hysterical. We're
gonna get in a fucking accident."
566,2137198,2139666,"He's laughing because I
wouldn't fuck her with his dick."
567,2144605,2146405,"Ho! Look at this place.
What a dump."
568,2146407,2148941,What are we doing here?
569,2148943,2150576,"We'll get a couple of drinks and get the
fuck out of here, go get somethin' to eat."
570,2150578,2152211,"I'm starvin'.
We'll go to Little Pete's."
571,2152213,2154346,"He's got these shrimp
in there, like this."
572,2154348,2155547,That's a cop joint.
573,2155549,2156949,"This fuckin' guy
don't stop eatin' shrimp."
574,2156951,2158517,"Fellas, how about
a round of shots on me?"
575,2158519,2159551,"No, we're good.
Thanks, pal."
576,2159553,2161854,"What do you mean? Come on.
How about just one shot?"
577,2163991,2167126,"Do me a favor, take a walk. You and
your fuckin' mustache, huh, please?"
578,2167128,2170129,"- Five cops walked in...
- Bartender, shots for me and my boys here."
579,2170131,2171964,"- The good stuff.
- Hey, we're good. Thank you."
580,2171966,2173465,"- Cheers. Salute.
- Hey, hey."
581,2173467,2175167,"You're too good
to have a shot with me?"
582,2175169,2176970,I said take a fuckin' walk!
583,2198025,2200159,"Yeah, motherfucker!"
584,2201896,2204897,"- You, fuckin' asshole!
- Motherfucker!"
585,2204899,2207299,"You motherfuckin'
piece of shit!"
586,2207301,2210403,You fuckin' motherfucker!
587,2210405,2212773,"- You want some?
- John, come on!"
588,2212907,2215609,"Come on. Let's get the fuck out.
Come on."
589,2222484,2224684,"I was swinging with everything, man.
I didn't give a fuck."
590,2224686,2226252,"When he came in,
I grabbed the barstool."
591,2226254,2227953,"- I grabbed two barstools...
- I saw you do that."
592,2227955,2229656,"- I don't give a fuck. I just keep goin'.
- Oh, my God."
593,2229658,2231491,"I was swinging. I didn't even
know who the fuck I was hitting."
594,2231493,2233326,"- You swang at the wrong guy three times.
- No, I didn't."
595,2233328,2235495,"You kiddin' me?
You hit the wrong kid."
596,2235497,2236865,He wasn't even with them. He was with the other kids.
597,2242571,2245773,You little motherfucker!
598,2246441,2247607,Did you have a fight tonight?
599,2247609,2249175,"- Did you?
- Yeah."
600,2249177,2251344,"Someone got killed!
Did you know that?"
601,2251346,2252445,"- Did you?
- No, I didn't know that."
602,2252447,2254180,"- John...
- You shut the fuck up!"
603,2254182,2257417,"You cocksuckers!
You're gonna ruin your future!"
604,2257419,2259152,Don't you understand?
605,2259154,2262023,"This is gonna follow you for
the rest of your fuckin' life!"
606,2266395,2268428,Someone got killed?
607,2268430,2271633,Not when I was there.
608,2272401,2276536,"Proudest moment of his life was watching you
graduate from military school, and now this?"
609,2276538,2278738,"Your father's crushed.
You know that?"
610,2278740,2281508,"- I know.
- No! You do not know anything!"
611,2281510,2283176,"- Dad, we didn't...
- Shut up!"
612,2283178,2285478,"I'll talk to you later.
The sharks are circling."
613,2285480,2287414,Cops are gonna shake him down.
614,2287416,2290049,"And that man's gonna pay
to protect you!"
615,2290051,2291584,I didn't kill the guy!
616,2291586,2294220,"I'll answer for it. Anything!
We didn't kill anybody."
617,2294222,2296958,"I know that.
But it doesn't fuckin' matter."
618,2297559,2299660,You two stupid motherfuckers.
619,2299662,2302630,"You brought a lot of fuckin'
heat down on this family."
620,2304166,2307367,"Actually, it was Angelo who
brought the heat down on the family"
621,2307369,2310403,"when the government released
what would become known as"
622,2310405,2313039,"""the Angelo Ruggiero tapes."""
623,2313041,2315041,"They picked up Ange
on a wiretap,"
624,2315043,2317678,"talking about various
activities that neither Paul"
625,2317680,2319949,"or the government
would've sanctioned."
626,2320348,2322248,Fucking Ange.
627,2322250,2323717,This is ridiculous!
628,2323719,2325285,"You got popped, Ange."
629,2325287,2327120,"Let me just ask you
one question."
630,2327122,2328722,"Are you badmouthing Paul
on them tapes?"
631,2328724,2330624,"- Are you?
- I don't know."
632,2330626,2332292,"- Come on! Come on!
- That's hundreds of hours, John!"
633,2332294,2333427,"What? You don't
remember nothing?"
634,2333429,2334728,They bugged my daughter's phone!
635,2334730,2337130,"What were you sayin'
on the tapes?"
636,2337132,2340701,"I said a lotta things that could get a lotta
people in a lotta trouble is what I said."
637,2340703,2342603,My friends are on those tapes.
638,2342605,2344338,Our friends are on those tapes.
639,2344340,2346774,"Neil, okay. If..."
640,2346776,2349175,"If Angelo decides that he doesn't
want to turn these tapes"
641,2349177,2351645,"over to Paul, what happens?
Is that it?"
642,2351647,2355583,No. That is most definitely not fucking it.
643,2355585,2360086,"If Paul wants the tapes, we gotta
get him the tapes. He's the boss."
644,2360088,2363056,"Boss is the boss is the boss,
that's ""La Cosa Nostra."""
645,2363058,2365292,"Don't tell me that I don't know
it's about La Cosa Nostra. Please."
646,2365294,2369196,"If it was just some fuckin' asshole
gettin' called out, or some Joe,"
647,2369198,2372066,"you know, I would authorize
the handover in a second."
648,2372068,2375269,"- But this... is our friends.
- Now, look."
649,2375271,2377271,"If the government has a case,"
650,2377273,2379740,"Paul will find out
when it comes to trial"
651,2379742,2382142,"because it'll be a matter
of public record."
652,2382144,2384712,"- You're fucked either way.
- We're fucked."
653,2384714,2387616,Okay. We're fucked either way.
654,2395224,2397224,"No, no."
655,2397226,2400195,"That's not gonna happen. Get
it out of your head right now."
656,2403165,2405000,"John. Hey, John."
657,2405802,2407601,Listen.
658,2407603,2411472,"You know that Paul doesn't give
two fucks about me or you."
659,2411474,2413374,"He's shitting bricks
over his own fuckin' case."
660,2413376,2414709,"You don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about."
661,2414711,2417012,"Ange, just shut
the fuck up, will ya?"
662,2417380,2419113,You got us into this mess.
663,2419115,2420849,"- Please.
- Get the fuck outta here, Ange."
664,2420851,2422584,Go on.
665,2433329,2435131,Christ almighty.
666,2435966,2440468,"I ain't sayin' you're wrong, but
what do you want me to tell Paul?"
667,2440470,2444839,"I mean... Ange sayin' to a boss, ""Fuck you, I
don't wanna hand over those fuckin' tapes."""
668,2444841,2446775,"I've been trying to make this
thing go away, but..."
669,2446777,2449345,Paul keeps bringing it up.
670,2450246,2453748,"Unless I say to him,
""Fuck you, go fuck yourself."""
671,2453750,2455850,"And then, you know
what we gotta do then, huh?"
672,2455852,2458252,We roll 'em up and we go to war.
673,2458254,2460187,"That's right, we gotta do
what we gotta do."
674,2460189,2462325,"We strike him
before he gets us."
675,2463360,2464859,Yeah.
676,2464861,2466895,What?
677,2466897,2468530,What's the matter? You okay?
678,2468532,2470398,"- Yeah, no...
- What do you need?"
679,2470400,2472102,It's just... it'll pass.
680,2472536,2475169,It's funny.
681,2475171,2478406,"All this fuckin' tapes
and trials,"
682,2478408,2480342,and we spend all this time
683,2480344,2482210,"tryin' to stay one step
ahead of the game,"
684,2482212,2485148,"but this fuckin' cancer,
I mean..."
685,2486650,2488852,"That is the ultimate
""fuck you."""
686,2496627,2499362,"If I didn't have bad luck,
I'd have no luck at all."
687,2503266,2505201,"Ah, beautiful!"
688,2506903,2508938,You got somethin' for me?
689,2509506,2511506,See this kid here?
690,2511508,2513208,"I used to give him five dollars
to go to the candy store."
691,2513210,2516212,"Now look at him,
he's a fuckin' earner."
692,2516881,2519949,"Here. Buy yourself
a new sports jacket,"
693,2519951,2522584,"'cause we are going
to Regine's tonight."
694,2522586,2524419,Tonight. Tonight.
695,2526556,2529092,"Let me tell you something
about your old man."
696,2529493,2532293,"When he was sent up to Green
Haven on the McBratney thing,"
697,2532295,2533662,"as you probably know about,"
698,2533664,2536564,"Carlo Gambino was so grateful
to your father"
699,2536566,2538701,for his service to him...
700,2540337,2543438,"...he got him
Roy Cohn to defend him."
701,2543440,2545908,"Roy Cohn, biggest fuckin'
lawyer in the country."
702,2545910,2549779,"Your dad wasn't even
a made man at the time."
703,2549781,2552347,"Cohn, he makes
a deal on a plea,"
704,2552349,2554583,"gets it reduced
to involuntary manslaughter."
705,2554585,2555985,Your dad's out in four.
706,2555987,2558721,"What a lot of people
don't know about is, uh..."
707,2558723,2561757,"how your dad came to be
arrested in the first place."
708,2561759,2564426,"Your dad was lyin' low,
he's in the wind,"
709,2564428,2567328,"and he hears I have this problem
with the Genovese family."
710,2567330,2572501,"He showed up, interceded on my
behalf at a sit-down in Maspeth."
711,2572503,2575738,"And the FBI picked him up
on a tip-off as he was leaving."
712,2576774,2579475,Loyalty cuts both ways with him.
713,2579477,2582611,"Your Honor, the
prosecution contends that Mr. Gotti"
714,2582613,2585448,"is a clear and continuing danger
to the community,"
715,2585450,2588017,"and in lieu of a potential life
sentence in this case,"
716,2588019,2590519,"it would be imprudent
to grant him bail."
717,2590521,2594824,"Thank you, Miss Giacalone, but you have not
convinced me that Mr. Gotti is a flight risk."
718,2594826,2597860,"The court grants bail in the
amount of one million dollars."
719,2597862,2600996,"Your Honor, as the court
has granted bail for Mr. Gotti,"
720,2600998,2604700,"we also request that bail be set at a
reasonable amount for Mr. Johnson."
721,2604702,2607002,"Your Honor,
we have strong reason to believe"
722,2607004,2610673,"that this defendant's life will be in
serious jeopardy if he is granted bail."
723,2610675,2612276,And why would that be?
724,2624922,2627523,"Because Wilfred Johnson has been
a confidential informant"
725,2627525,2629993,"for the FBI
for the past 19 years."
726,2629995,2631594,"- That is a lie!
- Order! Order!"
727,2631596,2633863,"Gotti!
They're lyin'! She's lyin'!"
728,2633865,2635564,"- I'll fuckin' kill you!
- Order!"
729,2635566,2637033,"- Lie! Lyin'!
- Order!"
730,2637035,2638734,"- Gonna get me killed!
- We will have order!"
731,2638736,2640971,"Counsel, restrain your client."
732,2641974,2646378,"In light of that information, if
confirmed, bail is denied on Johnson."
733,2650581,2652384,If I stand strong...
734,2653351,2657255,"if I refuse to testify,
and we win..."
735,2657790,2659357,...can I get a pass?
736,2659590,2661226,I'm begging you.
737,2662460,2664229,Swear it.
738,2665097,2668500,"Swear it on your kid's grave
you won't kill me."
739,2670702,2673037,How am I gonna kill a ghost?
740,2679410,2682012,"May I have
the verdict, please?"
741,2682014,2685048,"Me and Willie Boy Johnson
beat a massive RICO case"
742,2685050,2688485,"due to the lack of credibility
of the government's witness."
743,2688487,2692522,"...find the defendants, John
Joseph Gotti and Wilfred Johnson, not guilty."
744,2694126,2697295,"As for Willie Boy,
that's another story."
745,2699798,2701932,"Dominic's been doing
fireworks for years."
746,2701934,2703700,"Dominic ain't got
two fingers."
747,2703702,2705468,It's my gift to them.
748,2705470,2707470,"They can do the fireworks
the way I like it."
749,2712110,2714778,"- Look at this.
- Oh, this fuckin' thing."
750,2714780,2716179,"All right, you wanna
have some fun?"
751,2716181,2718350,Let's go have some fun.
752,2719618,2720984,Is there a problem here?
753,2720986,2722152,"We're shutting
you down, guys."
754,2722154,2723854,"This is an unpermitted
street gathering,"
755,2723856,2725889,"and there are illegal fireworks
on these premises."
756,2725891,2729025,"What are you talkin' about?
We been doin' this for 20 years."
757,2729027,2731595,"Let me ask you something. You're
gonna put these good people in jail"
758,2731597,2733964,"because they're proud of their country?
Is that right?"
759,2733966,2735465,You got my lawyer on the phone?
760,2735467,2737033,"- Standing by.
- You got bail money?"
761,2737035,2738635,"- With interest.
- Send 'em up!"
762,2745944,2748913,"Next time, Gotti.
Next time."
763,2752484,2755953,Gotti! Gotti! Gotti!
764,2755955,2757787,"This is your town, John."
765,2757789,2760757,Gotti! Gotti! Gotti! Gotti!
766,2760759,2763429,Gotti! Gotti! Gotti!
767,2766165,2768933,"Look at this one.
How good am I to you?"
768,2768935,2770503,"Go ahead, taste."
769,2773505,2774805,"- Huh?
- It's not bad."
770,2774807,2776409,I know.
771,2779812,2782046,Hey. Excuse me.
772,2782048,2785049,"I don't normally do this,
but I saw you walkin' over."
773,2785051,2788185,"I'd hate myself the rest of my life
if I didn't come and talk to you."
774,2788187,2790855,"Stop it, John.
You're not funny."
775,2790857,2793090,Wait. Do we know each other?
776,2793092,2795327,"What, you lose your memory at the
military academy or something?"
777,2796495,2798930,"It's me, Kim."
778,2798932,2801500,"Come on, John.
Joey Rug's daughter."
779,2802567,2803901,I'm sorry.
780,2803903,2806138,"It's just...
you look different."
781,2806739,2808673,Guess I grew up.
782,2808675,2810209,"Yeah, I guess you did."
783,2813813,2815548,"You wanna get a beer
or something?"
784,2815949,2817715,"John, I'm 16."
785,2817717,2819385,Oh!
786,2819953,2822221,"Uh, you wanna get a soda?"
787,2822522,2825124,"- Yeah, that sounds nice.
- All right. Let's go."
788,2827260,2828826,See ya both.
789,2828828,2831263,Joey Rugs.
790,2832632,2835599,"Paul wants to see you. And I
held him back as long as I can."
791,2835601,2837635,"Not the fuckin'
Angelo tapes again."
792,2837637,2840305,"It's got nothing
to do with Angelo."
793,2840307,2843042,"Paul has decided
to break up your crew."
794,2845144,2846811,"- He's gonna break up the crew.
- Mm."
795,2846813,2848612,The fuck does that mean?
796,2848614,2850315,"If Paul goes to prison,
he wants to make sure"
797,2850317,2852616,"that everybody knows
he's still the boss."
798,2852618,2855086,"It's like Carlo fuckin' Gambino
all over again."
799,2855088,2857555,"Everybody knows
that it should have been you."
800,2857557,2860591,"All right, well, what you want and
what you get are two different things."
801,2860593,2863195,"- If he wants reassurance, forget about it.
- No, no, no, he will get it."
802,2863197,2865830,"And you'd better fuckin' agree with
him or at least look like you do."
803,2865832,2867199,"He doesn't deserve it, Neil."
804,2867201,2870135,"Look... look, you gotta earn
your merits like we did."
805,2870137,2871303,What world are you livin' in?
806,2871305,2874139,"All fuckin' Paul
is about is money."
807,2874141,2875673,"Okay? That's his get-off.
That's it."
808,2875675,2877275,"Comin' from a fuckin'
degenerate gambler."
809,2877277,2879744,"You're goddamn right.
You can't take it with you."
810,2879746,2882381,Hm. Yeah.
811,2886987,2890624,"- If Paul makes a move on Angelo...
- You will live with it."
812,2890857,2893758,"- If he gives you that choice.
- There is no choice."
813,2893760,2896128,"- There's only what you do.
- Listen to me."
814,2896130,2898096,"You kill the boss
of bosses..."
815,2898098,2900866,"- I will defend my position.
- ...you will bring down hellfire."
816,2900868,2903436,"- I'll do what I gotta do.
- Not as long as I'm alive."
817,2907808,2910544,Jesus. I can't...
818,2910711,2912612,"I ju... I can't get
over Willie Boy."
819,2913080,2915482,Well.
820,2915749,2918351,"Shows you life
is full of surprises."
821,2918952,2921788,"He's been with you since
Fulton-Rockaway Boys, huh?"
822,2922890,2925891,"Bunch of punk kids who had the balls
to stick up one of my poker games."
823,2925893,2928360,"Yeah, you never know."
824,2928362,2930262,"I know.
He broke my fuckin' heart."
825,2930264,2932198,You give him a pass?
826,2933367,2935300,Yeah.
827,2935302,2937804,"Attack from the outside
you can deal with."
828,2938172,2941441,"But attack from the inside?
You're history."
829,2942142,2945777,"Once you take that first step,
there's no turning back."
830,2945779,2949214,"You either succeed, or
you're lost in enemy territory."
831,2949216,2952519,"And if you miss, you die."
832,2953053,2954754,And all your friends will die.
833,2956424,2958625,So you'll need DeCicco.
834,2959693,2963597,"If he's onboard, then Joe Piney will join
you, he'll take care of the old-timers."
835,2963897,2965665,And Gallo will go along.
836,2968869,2972272,"The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want."
837,2972773,2976242,"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."
838,2976244,2979445,"He leadeth me beside
the still waters."
839,2979447,2982080,He restoreth my soul.
840,2982082,2986821,"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake."
841,2986987,2990822,"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,"
842,2990824,2994993,"I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me."
843,2994995,2997598,Thy rod and Thy staff...
844,3022123,3024490,"In the name of the Father,
and the Son..."
845,3024492,3027528,"Obviously, Paul couldn't make
it, but he sends his prayers."
846,3044212,3046180,Let me tell you somethin'.
847,3046915,3049684,"Neil could have taken the family
from Paul any time he wanted."
848,3049951,3051117,Everybody knows that.
849,3051119,3053786,Paul. Up on that hill.
850,3053788,3056289,"You gotta kiss his ring
like he was the Pope."
851,3056291,3058192,Fuck Paul.
852,3059494,3062897,I hear you. I'm with you.
853,3074209,3075911,You'll need DeCicco.
854,3076645,3078378,"If he's onboard,
then Joe Piney will join you."
855,3078380,3080748,"He'll take care
of the old-timers."
856,3082083,3083985,And Gallo will go along.
857,3085186,3087554,"D.B. is important because he will
smooth out all the rough edges"
858,3087556,3089956,"and make sure that everybody
knows it's only business,"
859,3089958,3092828,"but you're gonna need the
approval of the other families."
860,3093094,3096996,"Frank and Sammy Bull
will pay homage to Brooklyn."
861,3096998,3099333,"The Luccheses
won't be a problem."
862,3099335,3103303,"You got Pescucci on your side, so the
Bonnanos we're not worried about."
863,3103305,3105606,Leave the Colombos to Angelo.
864,3106074,3109576,"He'll feel the pulse with
Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans."
865,3109578,3111545,And that leaves the Chin.
866,3112348,3115584,"Chin. You think
I'm a stickler for the rules?"
867,3116151,3118085,"Chin will not be happy
no matter what."
868,3118087,3120053,"But he'll be outnumbered, so..."
869,3120055,3121954,"for the sake
of a peaceful transition,"
870,3121956,3124057,"- he'll just have to accept.
- I don't know. I don't know."
871,3124059,3125325,"Paul and the Chin
are pretty tight."
872,3125327,3127261,"They got a lotta money
on the street."
873,3127263,3128428,"Yeah, well, you'll take care
of that after."
874,3128430,3130565,And use D.B. for that.
875,3130865,3134002,"Listen, nobody's cutting in
on Chin's action."
876,3134336,3136069,"On the contrary,
with Paul out of the way,"
877,3136071,3138505,"what's Chin's is Chin's,
free and clear."
878,3138507,3141375,"I have no doubt the other
families will back you,"
879,3141377,3143843,"but only if you have the support
of all five boroughs,"
880,3143845,3146546,"Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan,"
881,3146548,3150417,"Staten Island,
The Bronx. Eh?"
882,3150419,3152687,And that's a fist.
883,3159895,3162896,"So what it comes down to
is what do you wanna be."
884,3162898,3165599,"And I'm askin' you.
You wanna be consigliere?"
885,3165601,3168001,You wanna be underboss?
886,3168003,3170304,"Because we're gonna do this
thing, we're gonna do it right."
887,3170306,3172306,It's gonna be La Cosa Nostra.
888,3172308,3173875,La Cosa Nostra till I die.
889,3174109,3175944,"Underboss, John."
890,3178180,3180782,"Paul's set up a dinner
next Thursday."
891,3180983,3182384,Friends only.
892,3183085,3186988,"To discuss the reorganization
of the family."
893,3198233,3201134,"We're on
a piece of work."
894,3201136,3205373,"It's a big job, but there's no two
ways about it... it's gotta be done."
895,3205375,3206976,Give 'em the coats and hats.
896,3210680,3212647,"The hats is all anyone's
gonna remember seeing."
897,3212649,3214682,"We're around the corner
from the United Nations."
898,3214684,3216317,"They'll think the fuckin'
Russians are comin'."
899,3216319,3218553,Listen up. Pay attention.
900,3219689,3221423,We're hittin' Paul.
901,3228931,3231133,"And anyone else who's
in the car with him."
902,3241311,3243611,"It's gonna take place
at Sparks Steak House."
903,3249552,3252420,"That's up at 46th,
between 2nd and 3rd."
904,3255658,3258060,"He's got a six o'clock
reservation."
905,3262265,3264532,"There's gonna be a lot of last
minute Christmas shoppers,"
906,3264534,3266802,but that's perfect for us.
907,3270073,3271539,"We're gonna get
in and out... Bzang."
908,3271541,3273442,Like the Pittsburgh Steelers.
909,3275111,3278581,"So it's kill or be killed.
Let's go."
910,3311147,3312380,"- Jimmy.
- How you doin'?"
911,3312382,3314051,Good. Good.
912,3315218,3317151,"Can I have a bourbon and ice,
please?"
913,3317153,3318754,"So, Frank..."
914,3319623,3321924,"This business
with the Gotti crew..."
915,3322493,3324727,is very troublesome to Paul.
916,3336507,3338340,I know you like John.
917,3338342,3340476,"Hell, I like John."
918,3340478,3342377,"But now that
Neil's out of the picture,"
919,3342379,3346850,"Paul just wants to... shake
up the whole administration."
920,3359095,3361999,"And he wants you
to be comfortable with it."
921,3364635,3367170,"Eh, Paul's running
a little late."
922,3370841,3372142,Paul's here.
923,3374111,3375879,"He's not gonna
make dinner."
924,3382753,3384888,We gotta go.
925,3409480,3411748,"The assassination
of Paul Castellano"
926,3411750,3416686,"has local and federal officials looking
for the men who did it and for a motive."
927,3417354,3419588,"Finding either or both
extremely difficult,"
928,3419590,3421724,"given the secrecy
of organized crime,"
929,3421726,3424526,"we may never know
why Castellano was killed."
930,3424528,3426796,"Louis Young is standing by
in Staten Island"
931,3426798,3429300,"at the Castellano home
to tell us more."
932,3430134,3432802,"Mafia kingpin
Paul ""Big Paul"" Castellano"
933,3432804,3436539,"was gunned down gangland-style
in midtown Manhattan."
934,3436541,3439174,"The 70-year-old reputed head of
the largest and most powerful"
935,3439176,3442277,"crime family in the country,
the Gambino family..."
936,3442279,3443580,"- Uncle Ange.
- Mm?"
937,3443582,3445414,"- Where's my father?
- He'll be here soon."
938,3445416,3447617,"- Is everything okay?
- He's okay."
939,3447619,3449586,Because I heard Paul...
940,3450589,3451921,"It would be
a terrible mistake"
941,3451923,3454757,"to think that, uh,
that this is a good time"
942,3454759,3457560,"to go around, uh,
shooting up people."
943,3457562,3459629,"He's on a jet.
He's over Iceland,"
944,3459631,3463198,"and the stewardess comes up and she
says, ""My name is Pussy Galore."""
945,3463200,3465335,"He says,
""I must be dreaming."""
946,3472176,3473778,Fellas...
947,3476615,3479117,"We don't know who
killed Paul and Tommy."
948,3479217,3481119,But we're gonna find out.
949,3481686,3484922,"Conduct our own investigation,
get to the bottom of this."
950,3485957,3487191,That being said...
951,3488827,3492196,"our job now is to maintain
continuity of leadership."
952,3493898,3496801,"Make sure nobody thinks this
family's fallin' apart here."
953,3497235,3498836,So...
954,3500405,3502140,I nominate...
955,3503208,3504809,John Gotti.
956,3512384,3514051,I second the motion.
957,3531503,3533004,To the new boss!
958,3534339,3536774,"- John!
- Salute!"
959,3556796,3558595,"Whoa.
Hey."
960,3561734,3563435,"Congratulations, John."
961,3570443,3571944,How's it feel?
962,3572578,3575546,"Feels like times have changed,
and, uh, it's good."
963,3575548,3577514,"I mean how does it feel
to be here?"
964,3577516,3579318,This was Neil's joint.
965,3579618,3581418,It feels right.
966,3581420,3583487,"It feels like it's what
he would have wanted."
967,3583489,3585357,"It feels, uh..."
968,3586492,3588992,"Wherever he is, he's watching us."
969,3588994,3591196,Yeah.
970,3591797,3593363,And he ain't the only one.
971,3593365,3595399,"I want to talk
to you about that."
972,3595401,3598702,"Now, Nick Vilante's widow
lives upstairs."
973,3598704,3601905,"We can't kick her out
on the street, but..."
974,3601907,3605743,"if we have a serious conversation,
or it's raining, or it's snowing,"
975,3605745,3607077,"we give her a little something,"
976,3607079,3610515,"she vacates the premises
for 20 minutes and, uh..."
977,3610983,3612417,we take care of her.
978,3615788,3618388,"Yeah, I wish some of these guys
would take a walk."
979,3618390,3621692,Ah... Let 'em know.
980,3621694,3623462,Let everybody know.
981,3624530,3627866,"Now everybody comes to me.

1011,3719626,3721527,"Yeah. I did just like
you told me."
1012,3721628,3723862,"No, not just like
I told you."
1013,3723864,3725964,"- I dropped it off.
- Who'd you bring with you?"
1014,3725966,3727966,"- Well, I was gonna bring my niece, but...

1024,3775682,3778452,"He don't give a fuck. He's gonna
die in jail or the gutter."
1025,3779820,3781622,Makin' us look bad.
1026,3781956,3783956,Then there's DeCicco.
1027,3784091,3786159,"We know he arranged
the hit on Paul."
1028,3787194,3789128,That can't go unchecked.

1034,3850558,3852526,It was meant for you.
1035,3852727,3855094,"- What are you talkin' about?
- I am tellin' you,"
1036,3855096,3857763,"it was...
you-know-who did it."
1037,3857765,3859598,I heard it on good authority.
1038,3859600,3863236,"He and Gaspipe Casso are
like two peas in a fuckin' pod."
1039,3863238,3864670,"You heard, you heard."
1040,3864672,3866306,"Your ears are bigger
than your mouth."
1041,3866308,3868774,"Okay, first of all,
I am friends with Chin."
1042,3868776,3871810,"Second, Sam and Pipe
go way back. Am I right, Sammy?"
1043,3871812,3874114,"Oh, and they're all
grieving about Paul?"
1044,3874116,3875614,"Why would they grieve
about Paul?"
1045,3875616,3878985,"Look, whoever... killed Paul"
1046,3878987,3881054,did everybody a fuckin' favor.
1047,3881056,3882621,Maybe it was the cops.
1048,3882623,3884623,"Uh, you know, they
pit us against each other."
1049,3884625,3886825,"That's what they want us
to believe, am I right?"
1050,3886827,3888962,Let's take care of business.
1051,3888964,3891764,"Angelo tried to take
matters into his own hands,"
1052,3891766,3894600,"with an unsanctioned hit
on Gaspipe Casso."
1053,3894602,3897070,"That didn't work out
too well for nobody."
1054,3899274,3902109,"- Gaspipe!
- Who the fuck are you?"
1055,3902743,3904643,Ahh!
1056,3940949,3944385,"Good guys, bad guys
come in many different colors."
1057,3945053,3947722,"New York's finest,
serving two masters."
1058,3978887,3980689,I got all day.
1059,3981957,3983424,I got all week.
1060,3985328,3989263,"I mean, it's just me and you who are
just hanging out in the basement."
1061,3990199,3991634,Just give me a name.
1062,3993136,3994670,Tell me who it was.
1063,3994769,3996769,"- No.
- No?"
1064,3996771,3997873,Okay.
1065,4003412,4006414,"It hurts, doesn't it?"
1066,4007984,4009885,"- I can make it stop.
- Okay."
1067,4010953,4012119,I can make it all go away.
1068,4012121,4014888,Hm?
1069,4014890,4016324,Give me a name.
1070,4017193,4019260,Angelo Ruggiero.
1071,4020263,4021930,Angelo Ruggiero.
1072,4022165,4025434,"Thank you.
Thank you very much."
1073,4031774,4032841,You handle it.
1074,4033576,4036310,"Angelo tried to whack another
made guy without permission."
1075,4036312,4038479,You got no proof of that.
1076,4038481,4041515,"The shooter needed a little
encouragement, but he told Gaspipe."
1077,4041517,4045286,"He named Angelo. And there's no
good reason to disbelieve it."
1078,4045288,4047321,"Okay, but do I believe
everything I hear? No."
1079,4047323,4049490,"So I'm gonna do my
own investigation on this."
1080,4049492,4053460,"Oh, yeah? How's
the other investigation goin'?"
1081,4053462,4055529,"Heard anything
about Sparks Steak House?"
1082,4055531,4059268,"Yeah. The
Caesar salad is to die for."
1083,4060537,4062269,"Angelo's been askin'
for this a long time."
1084,4062271,4064104,"There's no dispute
about that."
1085,4064106,4065808,"Let me tell you
somethin', Chin."
1086,4065942,4069276,"Nobody touches Angelo.
Nobody."
1087,4069278,4072012,"If it's true that he acted
without my approval,"
1088,4072014,4074048,"I'll put him on the fuckin' shelf
like that."
1089,4074050,4076283,"I know Angelo's
more than a brother to you."
1090,4076285,4078219,"But Angelo
went off the record."
1091,4078221,4080988,"- This was unsanctioned.
- Okay, but let me tell you somethin'."
1092,4080990,4083290,"The life means more
than anything to Angelo."
1093,4083292,4084992,Okay? He's a war horse.
1094,4084994,4088664,It means more than it does to you or to me.
1095,4088798,4090565,"He wakes up thinking about it, he
goes to bed thinkin' about it."
1096,4090567,4092967,"If I put him on the shelf
for life,"
1097,4092969,4095772,"it's worse than puttin' a fuckin'
bullet through his heart."
1098,4098140,4099909,"Then I vote
to close this matter."
1099,4100876,4101976,The matter's closed.
1100,4104214,4106816,"The last time they moved me, John, do
you know the only thing I took with me?"
1101,4107584,4108818,"- Hm?
- No."
1102,4109286,4111419,Your indictment. That was it.
1103,4111421,4112420,"And do you know
why I brought it?"
1104,4112422,4115357,"Because I don't give a fuck
about my cancer."
1105,4115359,4117057,"I don't care what they do
to me in here."
1106,4117059,4118293,What'll be will be.
1107,4118295,4120395,"- My concerns are you.
- I know that."
1108,4120397,4122297,"I must have read it 50 times,"
1109,4122299,4124999,"and I tell you, I don't see it.
I don't see it."
1110,4125001,4128403,"I told you once I'd follow you
over a cliff. And I meant it."
1111,4128405,4129870,"But I'm thinking
about our family now."
1112,4129872,4132107,"Your family? What family
are you talkin' about?"
1113,4132109,4135076,"You're talkin' about your 400
brothers, cousins and uncles?"
1114,4135078,4139048,"Being a man is not being some guy
who's looking for closure, John."
1115,4139349,4143318,"My freedom and my life take a
back seat to my duty and manhood."
1116,4143587,4145987,"These are my standards, John."
1117,4145989,4148356,"Okay, now, listen up.
This is important."
1118,4148358,4151059,Never do anyone a small injury.
1119,4151061,4155530,"You wanna hurt someone? Hurt him so
bad he'll never come back at you."
1120,4155532,4159502,"Neil used to say to me, ""The
boss is the boss is the boss."""
1121,4160003,4162003,It ain't titles that honor men.
1122,4162005,4163907,It's men that honor titles.
1123,4184127,4186663,"Oh, Ange, Ange."
1124,4187097,4188865,What did you do?
1125,4191335,4192902,Ah...
1126,4195540,4199709,"I did what I thought
was best for you."
1127,4202145,4205348,"I saved your life, Ange.
That's all I can do."
1128,4206551,4208818,"The son of a bitch
killed Frank!"
1129,4211489,4215290,"I'm not goin' to war with the Chin for
the sake of Gaspipe fuckin' Casso."
1130,4215292,4216861,I ain't doin' it.
1131,4217362,4218796,"Now, listen here."
1132,4219330,4222099,"There's ten kinds of shitstorms
comin' down on us."
1133,4222633,4224065,"And you know
what I had to do?"
1134,4224067,4226603,"We had to have a meetin'
with the commission."
1135,4226637,4228270,Why? Because of you.
1136,4228272,4229672,Because of you.
1137,4232377,4235411,Every boss wanted you dead.
1138,4236113,4237081,Every one.
1139,4239584,4242552,"You're on the shelf for life.
That's it."
1140,4242986,4244387,Go. Go. Go.
1141,4305717,4309154,"- Get out of here!
- Uncle Ange! He needs you."
1142,4310021,4311655,"- He made a big fucking mistake.
- Don't say another word."
1143,4311657,4314758,"Don't you say one word against your father.
You hear me?"
1144,4319063,4320065,You hear me?
1145,4334312,4337781,"I had to. I can't be treatin' you any
differently than I treat everybody else."
1146,4337783,4341451,"Now, if I let you
violate my rules,"
1147,4341453,4344621,"the very principles
that we live by..."
1148,4345290,4347725,"it weakens me
and it weakens you."
1149,4348159,4350059,"Now, one day, you
may be the shot caller,"
1150,4350061,4352462,"you may be the one
that's making the rules,"
1151,4352464,4355232,"and then you would be responsible
for enforcing those rules."
1152,4355234,4356633,You know what I'm saying?
1153,4356635,4358568,"You gave me
the middle name Angelo."
1154,4358570,4360972,"How do you expect me
to turn my back on him?"
1155,4362674,4366044,"You pray that
I don't know about it."
1156,4369114,4370782,"I love him, too."
1157,4372084,4373517,Go to bed.
1158,4380726,4383628,"Who cares if he
goes to see Angelo?"
1159,4383862,4385862,"It's not like John's
a part of that life."
1160,4385864,4389801,"Victoria, please.
Don't start. Okay?"
1161,4411456,4413758,"Will the defendant
please rise?"
1162,4416528,4418797,Has the jury reached a verdict?
1163,4421333,4423868,"We, the jurors in the
above case, find the defendant,"
1164,4423870,4426704,"John Joseph Gotti,
not guilty."
1165,4426706,4429840,"I won this trial fair and square,"
1166,4429842,4432309,"thanks to a little down payment
to one of the jurors."
1167,4432311,4434779,"With my third victory
over the government,"
1168,4434781,4437447,"the media nicknamed me
""The Teflon Don."""
1169,4437449,4439282,I guess it stuck.
1170,4439284,4441217,"Mr. Gotti, are you the head
of the Gambino crime family?"
1171,4441219,4442720,I'm the head of my family.
1172,4442722,4443854,"Mrs. Gotti, do you know what
your husband does for a living?"
1173,4443856,4445690,He provides.
1174,4480360,4481894,You know why you're here?
1175,4482261,4483796,No.
1176,4485565,4487700,You know everybody in this room?
1177,4488701,4490301,Yes.
1178,4490303,4494238,"This is a society of brothers.
La Cosa Nostra."

a member of the Gambino family."
1180,4498411,4499877,Honor this oath.
1181,4499879,4502613,"If you divulge
any secrets of this family,"
1182,4502615,4504949,"your soul will burn
like this saint."
1183,4504951,4506817,"You never raise your hands
to a made man."
1184,4506819,4509353,"If you ever get caught with a made
men's wife, you'll be killed."
1185,4509355,4510956,We don't fuck with bombs.
1186,4510958,4513491,"We don't endanger civilians.
The use of drugs, prohibited."
1187,4513493,4518063,"Lastly, and most importantly,
we don't like rats."
1188,4518464,4520132,We kill rats.
1189,4521300,4522733,"You're questioned
by law enforcement?"
1190,4522735,4525171,"You tell them
to go fuck themselves."
1191,4525973,4529041,"You are now reborn.
This is your baptism."
1192,4529609,4531411,And we're your family.
1193,4533746,4535181,Come here.
1194,4561441,4562774,"I'd like you to meet
your new soldier."
1195,4562776,4565378,"This is your boss,

1198,4580359,4582828,Look at us.
1199,4582830,4584364,Look at us!
1200,4596410,4598278,"Ah, Elisa."
1201,4604918,4606752,"Now, Johnny."
1202,4606754,4609521,"It's like I said, it's gettin'
tougher, it's not gettin' easier."
1203,4609523,4612926,"You look around you, you got a
few good soldiers, am I right?"
1204,4613060,4614726,"Yeah, Dad,
I think you're right."
1205,4614728,4616962,"Okay, well, this is not
the time to make 20 guys."
1206,4616964,4618697,"You know what kind
of guys I need?"
1207,4618699,4621633,"I need guys that
do more than just kill."
1208,4621635,4625370,"I need guys whose hearts beat the
same, otherwise it won't work."
1209,4625372,4627506,"And the law is coming down
hard on us."
1210,4627508,4629808,You know that.
1211,4629810,4632410,"If worse comes to worst we can find you a
safe house, get you out of the country."
1212,4632412,4635580,"No. I don't run. And I don't
hide in shadows, either."
1213,4635582,4638617,"You know what I do need? I need one
year on the street, uninterrupted."
1214,4638619,4641853,"And I will build something
that nobody can destroy."
1215,4641855,4643488,"A hundred years from now,
when we're both dead,"
1216,4643490,4646527,"it'll still be and continue
to be a good thing."
1217,4647061,4648961,"It'd be one hell
of a legacy to leave."
1218,4648963,4650863,"A legacy.
Be it an hour from now,"

from now, when we're gone,"
1220,4654002,4655700,it'll be La Cosa Nostra.
1221,4655702,4657837,"And I'm not talkin' about gangs,
I'm not talkin' about clans,"
1222,4657839,4661908,"I'm talkin' about New York, Florida,
the fuckin' West Coast and back."
1223,4661910,4664478,"It's gonna be the way
I say it's gonna be."
1224,4668415,4670116,"About a year after
I put him on the shelf,"
1225,4670118,4672785,Angelo Ruggiero died of cancer.
1226,4672787,4676055,"Ange, I know I hurt you."
1227,4676057,4680194,"But you fucked up, and I had to
do what was best for the family."
1228,4684431,4687435,"Frankly, I think he died
of a broken heart."
1229,4695176,4697510,"By the way,
I almost forgot."
1230,4697512,4701147,"Sammy thinks that you should be
running your own crew now."
1231,4701149,4704150,"You paid your dues.
You're a credit to your father."
1232,4704152,4706886,"Normally I don't show you
no favoritism,"
1233,4706888,4710456,"but this time I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna handpick your crew."
1234,4710458,4711924,"I'm gonna give you Bobby,"
1235,4711926,4713960,"because I trust him
with my life."
1236,4713962,4715795,And I trust him with your life.
1237,4715797,4717163,Is that okay with Bobby?
1238,4717165,4718698,"Well, ask him."
1239,4718700,4720633,"What? Being under
a little punk like you?"
1240,4720635,4723169,"Madonna mia. My life, huh?"
1241,4723171,4725638,"You're the skipper now, Bo."
1242,4725640,4727673,"You say the word,
I'll go over a cliff for you."
1243,4727675,4730211,"You already are.
You're gettin' married."
1244,4737186,4739387,Yeah. Where's Victoria?
1245,4743458,4746193,"- Hey, John!
- Hey. Good to see ya."
1246,4746195,4748429,"- Good to see ya.

Nice work. Beautiful."
1249,4754535,4756103,Vic!

that they can tie you"

conspiracy. That's the problem."

I'm a member of the enterprise."
1415,5469724,5471557,"- We can beat them.
- And then what?"
1416,5471559,5474328,"They just throw more charges at
me like they did with my father?"
1417,5474762,5478364,"I've had enough.

you're saying?"

to walk away from this life,"
1423,5502256,5504323,I'm happy for you.

I'll ever see you again."

lot of thinking to do."
