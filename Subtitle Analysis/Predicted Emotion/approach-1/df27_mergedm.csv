The little dot of the laser wiggles from the vibrations. And if you can capture the pattern of the wiggling, you can translate that into waveforms you can actually hear. Why haven't we done this yet? Well, Pippa, it's probably illegal, and B, we can't. I mean, if we shine a laser into their apartment, it terminates. There's no way to capture the vibrations from across the street.
