Kat: That was the last time I saw my father. It turns out Beth, Mickey and Theo were right. A few weeks after I left, my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar, and confessed to killing my mother. He hung himself in his jail cell with a sheet. Before he died, he revealed that my mother's body was in the freezer, and that he'd taken it out during the night while I was sleeping. He buried her up in the mountains. Since it'd been frozen for so long, her corpse decomposed freakishly fast, turning to liquid as it melted. By the time they dug her up, there was basically nothing left. I was seventeen when my mother disappeared. Like, one day she was there, cleaning, making dinner, and the next... she was gone.
