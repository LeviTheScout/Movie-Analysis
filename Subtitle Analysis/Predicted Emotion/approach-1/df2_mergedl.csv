2,"Thu I don't know any Dickie Pep, but he's lying. Or you are. Why would he lie? You got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out. If he even exists. You don't seem too upset by what's happened. Of course I am, I'm traumatized. Who knows if I'll ever come again? I want that cunt in jail. We haven't got a case, Roy. Well, just fucking make one. Please. They'll order a psychiatric for bail. I'll make sure we get somebody good and tough. Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose, Miss Tramell's solicitor. This is Catherine Tramell. I shall be present during the evaluation. Well, that's fine by me. I'll be asking fairly personal questions. If she doesn't mind your presence... My client understands and agrees I should be present for... Maybe Dr. Glass is right and we should be alone for this. I strongly advise you not to contemplate having... So is this where we're going to do it? Mr. Rose told you the purpose of this evaluation. I'm applying for bail in a murder case. The Crown wants to know if I'm a danger to myself or others. You're the Crown's shrink, so you'll say I'm dangerous. My shrink will say I'm not, and the judge will flip a coin.

3,"Murder, sex, violence. Do you ever write about yourself? Not into autobiography. Really? Why not? Maybe I like to just sit back and get other people to reveal themselves. For instance, you look a little divorced. What makes you think I'm divorced? The ring line hasn't faded. You're very observant. Yeah, but am I wrong? Would it bother you if you were wrong? Would it bother you if I was right? Tell me something you're afraid of. Boredom. Is that why you like to take risks? I do like to take risks. Like taking drugs and having sex in a speeding car? Like talking to me without having your lawyer present? Actually, that was your idea. Like being on trial for murder? That's risky. You could end up in prison. Not if I'm innocent. Innocent people end up in prison all the time. Not rich, innocent people who are represented by Henry Rose. In that case, it isn't really exciting unless you're guilty. Oh, I bet you like to take risks, don't you, Dr. Glass? But I'm not the one who's on trial for murder. Not yet. Sorry, you're not allowed to smoke in here. You know what I like about you?

4,"which, of course, is intolerable. Do you consider Miss Tramell to be mentally impaired? Not by legal definition, no. Not at all. If released, is she likely to commit a violent crime? I believe her behavior is driven by what we call a risk addiction. A compulsive need to prove to herself that she can take risks... and survive dangers others can't. Especially the subsequent encounters with the police or the powers that be. Why would a person do that? The greater the risk, the greater the proof of her omnipotence. Her existence, really. When you say she has a risk addiction... is this condition likely to get worse? All addiction is progressive. The addict always needs to take greater risks. If other people are hurt or killed... as a result of her behavior, that's not likely to stop her? I think the only thing that'd stop her... I suspect the only limit for her would be her own death. Then she is a danger to herself. Yes, I believe she is. Nice work, Michael. Well done. Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell kill Kevin Franks? No, I can't make any comment, sorry. Can you please tell us about the bail? Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing you are all of a sudden. What are you doing here, Adam? Don't say you're writing about Tramell. A sexy, omnipotent killer with a Random House contract. Why would I write that? You don't know she's a killer. No, but I hope she is, though.

And how is my wife these days? Having fun? Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife. While we're chatting about killers... is there any chance of talking about George Cheslav? Who told you about Cheslav? Denise? That's got to be any shrink's worst nightmare. A patient in your care suddenly runs amok... beats his girlfriend to death with a brick. That was seven years ago, why talk about it now? Not quite seven, actually. Seven in July. But you talked to him twice a week. He never indicated he'd harm the girl? I don't talk about my patients. Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk about them when they're dead? No, not even when they're dead. Michael, what are you doing here? What did you tell Adam Towers about George Cheslav? Nothing. Can you give us a minute? He already knew. Really? Because he said you told him. No, all I said was... If he writes about that, if he puts it on his magazine cover... He won't. You're just being paranoid.

Did she mean it when she told him she wanted help? Even she wasn't sure. If things went well, then she meant it. If not, she didn't. That way, she'd be protected. She remembered the first time she met Irena... at the party in Bloomsbury. She felt a deep affinity for the older woman. As if the two of them leaning against the wall, silently smoking... The next time they saw each other... only brought the two women even closer. Even as Dr. Green watched them through the window... looking for any sign of conspiracy. Kelly found herself opening up, trusting the older woman... revealing things about herself... Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena. She was trustworthy, intelligent, beautiful, dignified. It was a pity Kelly was going to have to kill her. She dressed carefully.

It's about an American. A blond. A novelist. People around her just keep dying. But the question is: Who's killing them? Is the beautiful blond novelist a serial killer? Or is it the crooked cop? Her analyst isn't sure. But he goes crazy trying to find out. But that's just half the story. There's a twist. You see, the novelist never really killed anybody. And neither did the cop. The real killer all along... was the shrink. Yeah, from the moment he saw her... he knew she was the smoke screen he was looking for. His best opportunity to get even. First... he'd deal with that scumbag journalist. You see, you don't just go around stealing another man's wife. It's humiliating. Not that she was a complete innocent. That weekend slut.
