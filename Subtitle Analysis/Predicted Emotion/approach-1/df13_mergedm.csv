1,"Let me tell you something. The SCLC has direct Communist ties. Even great men can be corrupted, can't they? Communism is not a political party. It is a disease. It corrupts the soul, turning even the gentlest of men... into vicious, evil tyrants. What we are seeing is a pervasive contempt for law and order. Crime rates are soaring. There's widespread, open defiance of our authority... and, mark my words, if this goes unchecked... it will once again plunge our nation into the depths of anarchy. It all starts out peacefully, doesn't it, Mr. Irwin? You have to live with the fact... that you could've helped prevent the bombings and the violence. I'm more interested in what this says about your FBI. I have worked too long and hard to just sit back... and watch the bad guys capture the spotlight again, haven't I? The funny thing about notoriety... especially the kind that needs adoration, fame for fame's sake... if unchecked, it inevitably leads to villainy. I suggest you look at what this squabble is really about... before you destroy the reputation of the thing we both know you love most. Sir, the writer's here from Crime Records... the PR Department. Set him up with a typewriter in my outer office. Miss Gandy, it's time this generation learn my side of the story. - Right away. - Thank you. In 1919, Agent Smith... my first boss here at the Department of Justice... was Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. He was a Quaker.

2,"Believe what you will from historians... most write from a present perspective, forgetting context. Mitchell Palmer was a hero. Are you all right? - Are you all right? - Yes. I think. Yes. It's all right. Come here. - It's all right, it's all right. - No, it's okay. Are you okay? It's okay. Are you okay? You see, Palmer fought the radicals, just as I have. And just as I have, he was targeted. He wasn't alone. Across the country that night, eight bombs exploded, all at 11 p.m. Two United States senators... four cabinet members, a Supreme Court justice... John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan... all of them targeted by Bolshevik Communists. Yeah, it shook the whole thing. It was clear to me the radical's bomb went off too soon... leaving only his blood in the street. But the inspectors used buckets to clean up the mess instead of collecting it. They discarded his gun instead of preserving its prints. But you see, this wasn't clumsy police work. In those times, it was normal procedure. This may be the end of days for this country, Dwight. It was 1919, before anyone respected criminal science... before federal powers, before the FBI.

Well, let's leave that to the reader's imagination. You see, it's important we give our protagonist a bit of mystery. I could allude to a young man who matches your description. The best of both worlds. Where did you get your law degree? George Washington. I grew up here. I had a mom to take care of, so I stayed close. I received an English degree there also. Then I don't need to tell you that what determines a man's legacy... is often what isn't seen. What's critical at this moment is... that we re-clarify the difference between villain and hero. How do you think that compares with today? I'm not sure, sir. I'd like to hear more. I could come back tomorrow. Fine. But the pages stay here. Of course, sir. Agent Smith. Thank you, sir.

7,"Perhaps he'd like a fresh diaper. Should I find out what the Attorney General needs? No, I want the completed transcripts of the Los Angeles recordings. When I receive those, then we'll answer his buzzer. Very good. Edgar, Agent Smith is back. He, uh, has some questions about the Palmer Raids. Should I tell him to go? Helen, do you like him? I don't have an opinion of him yet. Well, I like him. I trust him. - I'll set him up in your outer office. - No. No, no, no. Bring him a desk in here. But in 1920, how could I protect us from anyone? Before I moved to this office, we were powerless. We had few federal laws, no right to carry firearms... and Congress liked it that way. Criminals ran free, but there was no law against keeping track of them... so I made a decision on my own. I compiled note cards and over five thousand names... and called the one department in Washington... that still held a small piece of untested power. Was that the Department of Labor? The power to deport, sir? But only to deport those who checked two boxes. They had to be foreign citizens and they had to be working to harm our country. And they cooperated with you? Of course not. No one freely shares power in Washington, D.C., Agent Smith.

8,"- What about the threat? - There might be a threat-- Might be? Fine. There is a threat to our country. But with no proof of a crime, there's no cause for deportation. We'll see about that. You'll be hearing from me. But one of their heads was a Mr. Caminetti. He was weary of our Justice Department, but he hated one person even more. I am a revolutionist by nature... and as such... I claim the right to rebel and resist invasion... by all means, force included. Emma Goldman. She was the hero of the radical movement. If I could hand Caminetti Emma Goldman, he would deport her without a thought. But she was a citizen. Would you like to stop, sir? No. I know it's hard for you to imagine today, but there was a time... when the average American feared for their safety and survival, Agent Smith. In Chicago, a coal strike started by communist labor shut off all the power. Riots followed. And on Armistice Day in Centralia, Washington... veterans fresh back from the war were murdered by radicals. The red revolution had arrived on our soil. No, no. We can't take them down one by one.

Against the wall, gentlemen, thank you. - How many are on our team? - Only you four for now. I'll have locks installed. No, Miss Gandy. That would bring too much attention. Nothing is to be alphabetically ordered. I want the cards to be broken down into subjects and categories. Now, this system should be easy enough if explained. If not, finding information should prove impossible. And trust no one, not even our fellow agents. Half our colleagues are on both sides of the payroll.

The man she married hasn't visited her once in prison, yet this man... the man she's lived with since her wedding, he visits nightly. What happens when we raid this list of yours and find nothing? No guns, no bombs, just innocent people deported. From every corner of this nation, the American people... have urged the Attorney General to do something about this... and return the United States back to peace.

If I could catch these radicals red-handed... then the Labor Department would have to put them all on boats back home.

11,"It was accomplished against great odds and at great personal peril. They found the counterfeiting press, five pistols, two automatics. And in Trenton, they found gunpowder, copper, brass wire, and batteries. - A bomb factory. - Yes. One hundred and twenty arrests in Detroit, 41 in Philadelphia, and 17 here so far. But everyone in the Bureau involved lost their job, correct? Even Palmer himself? Some did, and there's the lesson. You see, the bombs stopped, and peace came. The American people had forgotten there ever was a threat. So when political adversaries attacked Palmer... for trying to protect this nation from communism... our countrymen allowed it to happen. Because like today, they've forgotten the bombs, the blood, the fear. But why Palmer and not you, if you orchestrated the raids? I was 24 years old, Agent Smith. I was just following orders.

55,"First seal off his office, change his locks, do whatever you have to do. I want those fucking files. Yes, sir. Oh, good. Come in. He's upstairs. Ladies and gentlemen, it is with a profound sense of personal loss... that I learned of the death of J. Edgar Hoover. This truly remarkable man has served his country for 48 years... under eight presidents, as director of the FBI... with unparalleled devotion and ability and dedication. For 25 years, from the time I came to Washington as a freshman congressman... he has been one of my closest personal friends and advisors. And every American, in my opinion, owes J. Edgar Hoover a great debt... for building the FBI into the finest law enforcement organization... in the entire world. I've ordered that all the flags of the government buildings be flown at half mast... but I will say that, in doing so, that Edgar Hoover... because of his indomitable courage against sometimes very vicious attack... has made certain that the flag of the FBI will always fly high. The FBI is the eternal monument honoring this great American. Funny how even the dearest face... will fade away in time... but most clearly I remember your eyes with a sort of teasing smile in them...",88.02000000000001,212,First seal off his office change his locks do whatever you have to do I want fucking files Yes Oh good Come in He is upstairs Ladies and gentlemen it is with profound sense of personal loss that I learned of death of truly remarkable man has served his country for years under presidents as director of with unparalleled devotion and ability and dedication For years from time I came to as freshman congressman he has been of my closest personal friends and advisors And in my opinion owes great debt for building into finest law enforcement organization in entire world I have ordered that flags of government buildings be flown at half mast but I will say that in doing so that because of his indomitable courage against sometimes very vicious attack has made certain that flag of will always fly high is eternal monument honoring great Funny how even dearest face will fade away in time but most clearly I remember your eyes with sort of teasing smile in them,admiration
