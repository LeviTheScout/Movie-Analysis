1,"What the fuck is that? Jimmy? - What's up? - Did I hit something? What the fuck is that? Maybe you got a flat? Wha...? No. What the fuck? You better pull over and see. He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit! Die, you motherfucker! Look at me! As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me... being a gangster was better than being president of the United States. {\an8}Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job... I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there that I knew I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody else. They did whatever they wanted. They double-parked in front of a hydrant, nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer, when they played cards all night... nobody ever called the cops. Tony Stacks. How are you? Tuddy Cicero. Could this be the Canarsie Kid? - How are you? - Good. Tuddy. Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria... and other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss of the neighborhood. Paulie might have moved slow... but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody. - It's your fault. - You started it. I started it? It's your fault.

2,"- Bye, Dad. - Bye. See you, Mikey. Bye, Henry. Henry! Watch how you cross! Bring back milk! My mother was happy after she found out that the Ciceros... came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother... that was the answer to all her prayers. I was the luckiest kid in the world. I could go anywhere, I could do anything. I knew everybody, and everybody knew me. Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would toss me their keys... and let me park their Cadillacs. Here I am, this little kid, I can't even see over the steering wheel... and I'm parking Cadillacs. But it wasn't too long... before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand. For your mother and sister. For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job. But for me... it was definitely full-time. That's all I wanted to do. People like my father could never understand, but I was a part of something. I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up. Tell him 519. Every day I was learning to score. A dollar here, a dollar there. I was living in a fantasy. Did you have a good day at school? My father was always pissed off. Pissed that he made such lousy money... pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair. He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house. Tell me about this. It's a letter from school. It says you haven't been there in months. In months! You're a bum!

3,"After a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand. He knew what went on at that cabstand. Every once in a while, I'd have to take a beating. But by then, I didn't care. The way I saw it... everybody takes a beating sometime. - I can't make any more deliveries. - What? You'll fuck everything up. My dad says he'll kill me. Look. Come on with me. - Is that him, kid? - No. - How about him? - No. - That's the guy. - Get him. Excuse me. - Scumbag. - Come here, you piece of shit. - Know this kid? - Yeah. - Know where he lives? - Yeah. - You deliver mail to his house? - Yeah. From now on, any letter from that school to his house comes directly here. - Understand? - Yeah. Another letter from that school goes to that kid's house... in the fucking oven you'll go, head first. That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No letters from school. In fact, no more letters from anybody. Finally after a few weeks, my mother went to the post office to complain. How could I go to school after that... and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit? Paulie hated phones. He wouldn't have one in his house. Mickey called. Want me to call him back? All right, make the call. He got all his calls second hand. Then you'd have to call the people back... from an outside phone. Got a nickel? Get him on the phone. There were guys, that's all they did all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

4,"If there was a union problem or, say, a beef in the numbers... only the top guys could meet with Paulie to discuss the problem. Everything was one-on-one. Paulie hated conferences. He didn't want anybody hearing what he said... and he didn't want anybody listening to what he was being told. Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie, he got a piece of everything they made. It was a tribute, like in the old country, except they were doing it in America. All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off. That's what it's all about. That's what the FBI could never understand. What Paulie and the Organization does... is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. That's it. That's all it is. They're like the police department for wiseguys. People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with... and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many were waiting... I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore... even though we didn't have a car. At 13... I was making more money than most of the grown-ups around. I had more money than I could spend. I had it all. One day, some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home. You know why? It was out of respect. Hi, Mom, what do you think? - Look at my shoes, aren't they great? - My God. You look like a gangster. They shot me. Help! Henry, shut the door.

5,"Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ! I can't have that in this joint. I remember feeling bad about the guy... but I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right. I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building. You're a real jerk. You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy. What the hell's wrong with you? I got to toughen this kid up. It was a glorious time. And wiseguys were all over the place. It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe... decided to take on a boss and start a war. It was when I met the world. And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway. He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time... but he was already a legend. He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild. He'd give the doorman $100 just for opening the door. He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games. The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold. The Irishman is here to take all you guineas' money. - Want a drink? - Give me a 7 and 7. - I'd like you to meet the kid Henry. - How you doing? - Thank you. - Keep them coming. Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city. He was first locked up at 11... and he was doing hits for mob bosses when he was 16. See, hits never bothered Jimmy. It was business. But what Jimmy really loved to do... what he really loved to do was steal. He actually enjoyed it. Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.

Shrimp and lobsters were best. They went really fast. Almost all of them were gimmies. They just gave it up, no problem. They called him Jimmy the Gent. Help the lady. Drivers loved him. They used to tip him off... about the really good loads. Of course, everybody got a piece. Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later. Okay, see you later. Henry, come here. - Say hello to Tommy. - How're you doing, Henry? You're gonna be working together, okay? Help him. Go ahead. Jimmy, you got anything good?

You broke your cherry. Congratulations! By the time I grew up, there was $30 billion a year in cargo... moving through Idlewild Airport... and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it. See, you gotta understand, we grew up near the airport. It belonged to Paulie. We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place. They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out. If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble... Paulie had the union people scare them with a strike. It was beautiful. It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all. Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than Citibank. You got a phone? Come on!

They come as your friends. People who cared for you all your life. They always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help. So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew. I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there. He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up. He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed. He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case. But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck. I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the phone. Now you understand? It's going to be okay.

Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that? Mm-mm. No, not at all. That way they got nothing. Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before. But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony. That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive. Whenever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again...

I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen. I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed. People call them rats because rats do anything to survive. Isn't that right? - Objection! - Objection sustained. - I know nothing about being a rat. - You know everything about it. Objection, Your Honor. In view of the violence... Anything I wanted was a phone call away. Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city. I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend... then blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay the bookies. It didn't matter. It didn't mean anything. When I was broke I would go out and rob some more. We ran everything. We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers. We paid off judges. Everybody had their hands out. Everything was for the taking. And now it's all over. That's the hardest part. Today everything is different. There's no action. I have to wait around like everyone else. Can't even get decent food.
