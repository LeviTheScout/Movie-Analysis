It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream. A man possessed of some radical notions. COBB: What is the most resilient parasite? A bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? ARTHUR: Uh... What Mr. Cobb is trying to say... An idea. Resilient. Highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks. Right in there somewhere. For someone like you to steal? Yes.

10,"Such as? Imagine you're designing a building. You consciously create each aspect. But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean. Yeah, like I'm discovering it. Genuine inspiration, right? Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this. We create and perceive our world simultaneously. And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening. That allows us to get right in the middle of that process. How? - By taking over the creating part. Now, this is where I need you. You create the world of the dream. We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious. How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality? Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange. Let me ask you a question.

Why don't you give us another five minutes? Five minutes? What...? We were talking for, like, at least an hour. In a dream, your mind functions more quickly... therefore time seems to feel more slow.

That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb! She's a real charmer. - Oh. I see you met Mrs. Cobb. - She's his wife? Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.

That would defeat the purpose. See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die. That way, when you look at your totem... you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream. I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to... but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there. And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that. [DOOR CLOSES] She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before. Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back... When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes. Where are you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames. Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard. It's a necessary risk. Well, there's plenty of good thieves. - We don't just need a thief. We need a forger.
