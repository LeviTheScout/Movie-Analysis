Number Three, is your section ready to carry out Kronsteen's directives? Yes, Number One. The operation will be organised according to Kronsteen's plan. I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian Consulate in lstanbul. She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to the state is beyond question. You're sure she believes you're still head of operations for Soviet lntelligence? It is most unlikely she would know I'm now working for SPECTRE. Moscow kept my defection secret from all but a few members of the presidium. For your sake, I hope so. Kronsteen, you're sure this plan is foolproof? Yes, it is. Because I have anticipated every possible variation of countermove. But what makes you think that M, the head of British lntelligence, will oblige you by falling in with your plan? Because this is so obviously a trap. My reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge. And they couldn't possibly pass up even the slightest chance of getting their hands on the Lektor decoder. They have wanted one for years. All that you say could be true. What else?

It was used as an ablution fountain. It contains a thousand litres of water. Right after the ablution fountain, we are going to a highly interesting column over there, known for centuries as the Saint Sophia wishing column.
