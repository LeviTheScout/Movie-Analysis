2,"He just glanced at it and said, ""I'm aware of the situation."" - Then why does he do nothing? - I asked him that. ""Why overlook the corruption of your vice-chamberlain and provincial steward in the daimyo's absence?"" He smiled and said, ""Perhaps I'm behind it. You all think I'm a good-natured halfwit, a scarecrow who'll do your bidding. People aren't what they seem. Be careful. You'd never suspect who the worst are. Be careful."" Then he tore - - He tore it up? He really went too far. And then? I gave up on him. I met with Superintendent Kikui, as we planned. What did he say? He understood our position, just as expected. At first he seemed troubled and said he'd discuss it with my uncle, but when I told him my uncle's words, he was shocked. He thought about it and said, ""All right. I'm with you. I'd like to talk with your group. Gather all your men quickly."" There you have it. - Kikui's the real thing! - We can reason with him. He's extremely influential. He's no good-natured scarecrow. Wait just a minute. - That's quite a story. - You heard us? Stop him! Imbecile. Do I look like I'm going anywhere? What the hell are you doing here? It's a free room for the night.

3,"""The spectator sees more than the player."" He can judge the right course of action. Listen. If you ask me, the chamberlain is the real thing, and the superintendent is a phony. What? Such insolence won't go unpunished! Don't get all testy. I haven't seen either of their faces, so I can't be fooled by their looks. The chamberlain is ugly, isn't he? I guess I must be right. But judging from your story, he must be a great man who doesn't care if you think he's a fool. But this Superintendent Kikui - You say he's the real thing, ""just as expected."" That must mean he looks the part. Am I right? But people aren't what they seem. Be careful. Enough! What does a worthless ronin know? I'm just repeating what the chamberlain said. Don't you get it? His words were even more precise: ""You'd never suspect who the worst are. Be careful."" I may be wrong, but it sounds like Kikui is the rotten one. Fool! Quiet down and listen.

Is there somewhere we can hide? There's a barn just ahead. Good. Let's go. Koiso! What's wrong? Master Izaka! Fool! This is no time for tears. My lord is in terrible trouble! Calm down. Tell us what happened. The superintendent suddenly arrived with a host of men. We were eating - - Never mind that. Where's my uncle? Ten men took him away. Where the hell were the guards?

7,"Then we can rescue the chamberlain's old lady and the girl. I see. Koiso, will you go back? Yes, I will. Now there's a samurai. More reliable than all of you. We're grateful, but please watch your language. Calling the chamberlain's wife his ""old lady""... And it's annoying to have you decide our every move. You want to rescue the ladies first, but the chamberlain's safety is more pressing. Very well. Where is he then? We can't rescue him without knowing where he is. What's the superintendent planning to do with him? We can't do anything without knowing that. Kikui must've told the old lady why he hauled her husband off. Don't you wanna ask her what she knows?

8,"Nobody thinks to look right under his own nose. There are three guards. I'll knock one down, and you two take him prisoner. Don't kill him. He may tell us where the chamberlain is. While I do away with the other two, you rush in and rescue the women folk. We'll meet back at the barn. Got it? Why are you looking at me like that? You want to draw your swords? Forget it. A stupid friend's sword is deadlier than an enemy's. I don't want to get cut to pieces. That's the guardhouse. Your plan seems to have worked. Now's our chance. That was close. They've changed the guard. Muroto. You just met him at the shrine. He offered me a job. What's he do for Kikui? - Henchman and enforcer. Let's go now. He's alone. Are you blind?

9,"He thought of everything, didn't he? Who is that gentleman? It's hard to explain. A strange series of events has made him our ally. Indeed, he saved our lives. - Is that so? Thank you. What's keeping those two? It's dangerous staying here. Yes, but I've never run so in my entire life. I must rest a bit or I shan't even be able to walk. This is my first time here. The hay smells lovely. I love this smell. We come here often, don't we, Iori? I'll find those two. Why do you two come here? It's so quiet, even in the daytime. You can lean back in the hay and feel like you're floating. Enveloped in its scent, you drift into a dreamy haze. You know, I even fell asleep once on Iori's arm. Not very ladylike. But... actually... it does smell nice. No wonder they were late. They were dunking his head in the pond to make him spit out my uncle's location.

10,"What do we do? He saw our faces. We have to kill him. That just won't do. And you killed the other two as well, didn't you? I did it to rescue you. I had no choice. I hesitate to say this after you so kindly saved us, but killing people is a bad habit. You glisten too brightly. - Glisten? - Yes. Like a drawn sword. A drawn sword? You're like a sword without a sheath. You cut well, but the best sword is kept in its sheath. So what do we do with him? Come with us, will you? We won't harm you. - Over here! - What is it? Hurry! Over the rear wall! That way! Guard the front gate! Hurry! That may be easy for you, but for us it's impossible. Just try. We can't. Isn't that right, Mother? Hurry!

I'm smarter when I drink. Sounds like Kikui plans to pin his crimes on Chamberlain Mutsuta. They may even force him to write a confession, and then - And then what? You can be frank with us. They'll make him commit harakiri. What shall we do, Mother? There's nothing to fear. Your father is a shrewd old fox. It won't be easy to make him commit harakiri. Now, what do you gentlemen intend to do next? First we'll find Uncle and bring him back. Then - That's all you need to do. Pinning the blame on your uncle is practically a confession of guilt.

Why don't you calm down and have another drink? But Kurofuji, what's going to happen? I doubt Mutsuta will write a confession so easily. Leave that to Kikui. Have a drink. But Kikui's made one blunder after another. Chamberlain Mutsuta is making trouble. We underestimated him. - You mean - No, there's still a way. We'll use his wife and daughter. Who's there? - Muroto. Muroto's reporting to Kurofuji right now. Telling him he lost my aunt and Chidori, no doubt. If he's taking that report next door, that means the traitors are there right now.
